Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKIraq has long suffered under greedy rulers. Saddam Hussein treated the state’s resources as his own. Since he was ousted by American troops in 2003, successive elected governments have been riddled with graft. Officials take cuts from contracts or hire ghost workers and pocket their salaries. Even so, a recent alleged theft is hard to top. Since September 2021 the country’s tax deposits have been raided to the tune of 3. 7trn Iraqi dinars ($2. 5bn), according to an investigation by the finance ministry cited by Iraq’s new prime minister, Muhammad al-Sudani. Corruption on this scale helps explain why many of Iraq’s 41m people do not have reliable water or electricity, even though their country is the second-largest oil producer in the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). On paper the funds handled by the tax commission were paid out through five shell companies, some set up by an Iraqi businessman, Nour Jassim. Investigators believe the funds were then distributed among a variety of politicians and officials demanding hush-money and bribes to facilitate the scam and to frustrate investigations. Such were the volumes traded that the dinar weakened against the dollar, while the cost of property in Baghdad’s posher quarters rose. MP s and people in the then prime minister’s office failed to sound the alarm. \"Vast underground networks of senior officials, corrupt businessmen and politicians operate in the shadowsand siphon off literally billions of dollars from the public purse,\" wrote Ali Allawi after resigning as finance minister in August in protest against government shenanigans. Since leaving office, Mr Kadhimi is thought to have moved to Europe. He and officials in his office have denied any wrongdoing. Mr Sudani, the first Iraqi prime minister to have lived in Iraq continuously since the American invasion in 2003, has vowed to root out corruption. One investigator, suspecting that more shell companies will be uncovered, reckons that between a third and a quarter of last year’s government budget of $92bn has gone astray. Last month Mr Sudani spoke on television (pictured) between two pallets piled head-high with cash, which was in part recovered from Mr Jassim as he prepared to fly out of Baghdad in a private jet. Mr Sudani has promised to recover the remaining cash. His advisers say he will seek to extradite former officials suspected of corruption who are now abroad, including some in America. After six weeks in office he is said to have purged around 900 officials, including civil servants and security officers. Friends of Mr Kadhimi say Mr Sudani is seeking to tighten his grip on his office by throwing allegations of corruption at his predecessor’s circle. It tends to start at the topFew believe this will stop the rot. The legitimacy of Mr Sudani’s new government is debatable, since it consists of factions that lost the general election in October last year and includes many of the groups that supped at the previous government’s trough. The same MP s who voted to endorse Mr Sudani as prime minister also voted to remove Mr Allawi’s successor as acting finance minister when he sought to publish the results of the investigation into the theft of tax revenues. Mr Sudani has also launched a state-financed company to administer government projects. It is run by a caucus of pro-Iranian Shia militias known as the Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation Forces), whose political wings dominate Mr Sudani’s coalition. After helping to defeat the jihadists of Islamic State, who conquered a swathe of Iraq and Syria in 2014, the Hashd insists that its mission is to rebuild Iraq. It has been allowed to create its own commercial firm. This is called al-Muhandis, after the deputy commander of the Popular Mobilisation Forces who was killed by the Americans in a drone strike at Baghdad airport in 2020, along with Qassem Suleimani, the commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Having won the upper hand in Iraq’s factional fights over politics and security, the Hashd’s leaders hope to gain sway over a chunk of the economy, including the oil industry and house-building, much as the IRGC has done in Iran. Al-Muhandis is bent on winning a string of fat government contracts. \"It will kill what remains of the private sector,\" says Muhammad Koperly, a lawyer based in Baghdad. Some fear that the new company will bind Iraq’s economy ever closer to Iran’s. Others doubt it will be effective. \"It will be just another crazy fund for corruption,\" says a former official. Mr Sudani seems loth to let the probe into the gigantic tax swindle extend to the upper echelons of his own government. On his watch Mr Jassim has been freed on bail and is thought to have fled abroad. Several of the tax-authority officials overseeing the transfers were appointed by Badr, a pro-Iranian party that is in the vanguard of Mr Sudani’s ruling coalition, yet none of them has so far been charged. A former official doubts the new prime minister’s sincerity. \"They can’t follow the leads because the whole house would come crashing down,\" he says.",

Some members of one squad could just as well have played for their opponents in a clash of hyphenated identities.

Saudi Arabia defeated Argentina Japan beat Spain and Germany to emerge atop their bracket. By the semi-finals, though, the remaining teams looked mostly predictable defending champions France, two-time winners Argentina, and Croatia, the runners-up in 2018. Mostly predictablebut not entirely. Morocco won four of their first five games, becoming the first Arab or African squad to reach the semi-finals. Though they fell to France on December 14th, they played with passion befitting their victories, which sparked raucous celebrations in the Arab world, Africa, and among migrs in Europebut also curious arguments. Most of Morocco’s 26-man squad were born abroad. Achraf Hakimi grew up in Madrid to poor Moroccan parents. He chose to play for the squad of his heritage and on December 6th netted the winning penalty kick against Spain. European football has become so diverse that most fans barely notice. Now Morocco has created its own squad of players with complex identities. Morocco’s Africanness is obvious if you look at a map. But it comes with subtle tensions. Some sub-Saharans sniffed that north Africans look down on them. As for Morocco’s Arabness, that has been the subject of debate in cafs, fan zones and on social media. For the affirmative Morocco is a member of the Arab League, Arabic is an official language, and its rich culture has contributed much to that of the broader Arab world. Many Moroccans identify as Arabs, and their victory was celebrated across the region. Yet some Moroccans are uncomfortable with the label. A plurality (perhaps even a majority) are of Berber descent, and Arabism can imply an erasure of their identity. Tamazight, the Berber tongue, was long relegated to second-tier status. It was only made an official language in 2011, part of a package of reforms rushed through to placate the public during the Arab spring. It is a strange debate. If it had been Egypt, another north African country, that reduced Ronaldo to tears, no one would have hesitated to call it an Arab victory. Perhaps distance explains some of the disagreement. In Riyadh on the night of Morocco’s knockout-stage victory, one Saudi called it a win for the entire Arab world, while another said he felt little affinity for a country as far away as Thailand. Prejudice plays its part. The Moroccan dialect, known as darija, is widely mocked by other Arabic-speakers for being hard to understand. Moroccan women are often crudely maligned as prostitutes. A long-held stereotype in the Gulf suggests they use witchcraft to seduce innocent men \"Moroccan maids may spell trouble, warn some women,\" read one decade-old headline in a Saudi newspaper. Modern Arab nationalism, which took form as the region emerged from centuries of Ottoman and European rule, has always been rooted in politics. It appeared on the pitch as well. The Moroccan squad unfurled a Palestinian flag after beating Spain. The gesture won an outpouring of support from many Arabs, for whom Israel’s half-century occupation of Palestinians’ land remains an injustice. It probably looked less noble to the people of Western Sahara, who have been occupied by Morocco for 46 years a former victim of colonialism can also be a colonial power (and was once part of a Muslim empire that ruled much of what is now Spain and Portugal). Israelis have been free to attend the tournament, though they are not normally allowed to visit Qatar. A fair number have expressed surprise at their frosty treatment from Arab fans. Since four Arab countries (Morocco among them) agreed in 2020 to normalise ties with Israel, many hoped the region had forgotten about the Palestinians. The World Cup has been a reminder that, even if many Arab rulers no longer care, many of their subjects still do. Add one more contrasting note the celebrations in Israel, by Jews of Moroccan descent, a reminder that the kingdom once had a vibrant Jewish communityand that less separates Israelis from their Arab neighbours than many wish to admit. Talk of pan-Arabism can often feel dated, as it harks back to the heady nationalist days of the 1950s, or the grand caliphates of yore. Yet enthusiasm for Morocco’s unlikely success shows that a cultural affinity still binds people in the region. Equally, though, the arguments over Morocco’s place in that region show how identity is still used to divide rather than unite.",

                "israelis have been free to attend the tournament, though they are not normally allowed to visit qatar. a fair number have expressed surprise at their frosty treatment from arab fans. since four arab countries (morocco among them) agreed in 2020 to normalise ties with israel, many hoped the region had forgotten about the palestinians. the world cup has been a reminder that, even if many arab rulers no longer care, many of their subjects still do.",
                "add one more contrasting note the celebrations in israel, by jews of moroccan descent, a reminder that the kingdom once had a vibrant jewish communityand that less separates israelis from their arab neighbours than many wish to admit.",
                "talk of pan-arabism can often feel dated, as it harks back to the heady nationalist days of the 1950s, or the grand caliphates of yore. yet enthusiasm for morocco’s unlikely success shows that a cultural affinity still binds people in the region. equally, though, the arguments over morocco’s place in that region show how identity is still used to divide rather than unite."

A coconut going for 500 Tanzanian shillings ($0. 20) a few years ago today sells for 1,500 shillings.

Coconuts have become expensive for local people. \"Why have prices gone nuts \"People are chopping, chopping,\" explains Omar Yusuf Juma, another coconut seller, swinging his machete for effect. A count in 2013-14 found just 3. 4m coconut trees, down from 5. 7m in the late 1990s. Since hungry Zanzibaris still demand creamy fish curries and beans baked in coconut milk, falling supply has led to higher prices. Nuts from the mainland are pricier because of high transport costs. The felling of coconut trees reflects how Zanzibar and the rest of Africa are urbanising. The defining feature of Africa’s expanding cities is sprawl cities are oozing outwards rather than growing upwards. As Zanzibar City has spread farther into erstwhile countryside, when people move to their new plots they chop down the coconut trees to make space for their new homes. Moreover, some houses, as well as many island hotels, have furniture made from coconut wood. Emmanuel Elias, a carpenter, explains that it is cheaper than imported alternatives. By law farmers cannot chop down fruit-bearing trees for furniture in practice it is hard to stop them. Even if they abide by the rules, many do not plant new trees, since these take at least six years to produce fruit, and 15 years to reach maximum production levels.

No fewer than 56 parties fielded candidates for their district. They had a rather easier time of it in Tunisia’s parliamentary election on December 17th only one candidate was on the ballot. It is hard to imagine that there was very much suspense in his campaign headquarters as the results came in. Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the element. Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKThis was the climax of a 17-month power grab led by Kais Saied, the country’s authoritarian president. In July 2021 he suspended much of the constitution and sent the army to bar the doors of parliament he later dismissed its members. He went on to sack judges install loyalists in key agencies, including the electoral commission and harass and arrest critics. This summer he hastily shoved through constitutional changes to dilute parliament’s power. In a grim bit of irony, the election came 12 years to the day after Muhammad Bouazizi, a street hawker, set himself on fire to protest against extortion by the local police. His death was the spark for the overthrow of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, the longtime dictator, the creation of a flawed but real democracy in Tunisia, and the Arab spring more generally. By the time Mr Saied was elected in 2019, many Tunisians had come to despair of their post-revolutionary politicians, who seemed more interested in fighting each other than fixing problems. The president has lived up to his promise to change the political system. Yet he has done almost nothing to tackle the economic mess that caused so much of the public’s anger, which may soon be directed at him. Mr Saied, who blames political parties for much of the deadlock, sought to reduce their role in this election party logos, for example, were not displayed on ballots next to the names of candidates. Major parties decided to boycott the poll, and only 1,058 candidates met the requirements to run for 161 seats. Beyond La Goulette, nine other districts had one-man races. Elsewhere the choice was even simpler seven of ten constituencies that represent the diaspora had no candidates. The Tunisian embassy in London did not bother to open a polling station because there was nobody to vote for. Even where races were competitive, the candidates were often nobodies. The party boycott left a motley crew of individual candidatesanyone who could gather 400 signatures and self-finance a short campaign. Many Tunisians had no idea who was on the ballot. The electoral commission wound up affixing a headshot of each candidate next to his (rarely her) name instead of voting for parties, voters could opt for the candidates with the best hair. Turnout was predictably low, with only about 800,000 of the country’s 9m registered voters bothering to show up. Mr Saied had promised that the new parliament, freed from the shackles of party politics, would be the most democratic in Tunisia’s history. Instead he delivered a legislature elected by less than 9 of voters. The Salvation Front, an opposition group, quickly called for protests and demanded that Mr Saied step down. So did Abir Moussi, who ran against Mr Saied in the presidential election of 2019. The front includes Ennahda, an Islamist party that has been a powerful force in Tunisia’s democratic politics, whereas Ms Moussi is a staunch anti-Islamist and self-professed admirer of the deposed dictatorship. That such ideological opposites find themselves aligned against Mr Saied says much about his dwindling support. At first his self-coup in 2021 had wide backing from a frustrated public. Polls showed his approval ratings above 80, unprecedented for a Tunisian president (or, indeed, for most politicians). But his popularity was short-lived. Official turnout for the constitutional referendum in July was a mere 30, and many think that number was inflated. His poll numbers keep sliding. Few Tunisians turn up for pro-Saied rallies. There is little optimism that Mr Saied’s government and his new rubber-stamp parliament will do much to turn around the economy. The diagnosis has not changed much Tunisia is unproductive. It has a bloated public sector with one of the world’s highest wage bills (18 of GDP). State-run companies are uncompetitive. Decades of underinvestment in the poorer south and west have left those regions lagging far behind Tunis, the capital. If the root causes are unchanged, though, the symptoms have worsened. The economy shrank by almost 9 in 2020 and growth remains sluggish. Soaring food and energy prices this summer caused a balance-of-payments crisis, with shortages of sugar, butter, cooking oil and other staples as imports languished at ports. Even bottled water has been rationed. Annual inflation jumped to 9. 8 in November. It is a truly unhealthy democracy that announces a voter-turnout figure lower than its headline-inflation rate. What has saved Mr Saied, until now, is apathy. If he cannot organise big rallies, neither can the opposition most Tunisians are too disgusted with politics (and too busy trying to survive) to take to the streets in protest.",

                "mr saied, who blames political parties for much of the deadlock, sought to reduce their role in this election party logos, for example, were not displayed on ballots next to the names of candidates. major parties decided to boycott the poll, and only 1,058 candidates met the requirements to run for 161 seats.",
                "beyond la goulette, nine other districts had one-man races. elsewhere the choice was even simpler seven of ten constituencies that represent the diaspora had no candidates. the tunisian embassy in london did not bother to open a polling station because there was nobody to vote for.",
                "even where races were competitive, the candidates were often nobodies. the party boycott left a motley crew of individual candidatesanyone who could gather 400 signatures and self-finance a short campaign. many tunisians had no idea who was on the ballot. the electoral commission wound up affixing a headshot of each candidate next to his (rarely her) name instead of voting for parties, voters could opt for the candidates with the best hair.",
                "turnout was predictably low, with only about 800,000 of the country’s 9m registered voters bothering to show up. mr saied had promised that the new parliament, freed from the shackles of party politics, would be the most democratic in tunisia’s history. instead he delivered a legislature elected by less than 9 of voters.",
                "the salvation front, an opposition group, quickly called for protests and demanded that mr saied step down. so did abir moussi, who ran against mr saied in the presidential election of 2019. the front includes ennahda, an islamist party that has been a powerful force in tunisia’s democratic politics, whereas ms moussi is a staunch anti-islamist and self-professed admirer of the deposed dictatorship. that such ideological opposites find themselves aligned against mr saied says much about his dwindling support.",
                "at first his self-coup in 2021 had wide backing from a frustrated public. polls showed his approval ratings above 80, unprecedented for a tunisian president (or, indeed, for most politicians). but his popularity was short-lived. official turnout for the constitutional referendum in july was a mere 30, and many think that number was inflated. his poll numbers keep sliding. few tunisians turn up for pro-saied rallies.",
                "there is little optimism that mr saied’s government and his new rubber-stamp parliament will do much to turn around the economy. the diagnosis has not changed much tunisia is unproductive. it has a bloated public sector with one of the world’s highest wage bills (18 of gdp). state-run companies are uncompetitive. decades of underinvestment in the poorer south and west have left those regions lagging far behind tunis, the capital.",
                "if the root causes are unchanged, though, the symptoms have worsened. the economy shrank by almost 9 in 2020 and growth remains sluggish. soaring food and energy prices this summer caused a balance-of-payments crisis, with shortages of sugar, butter, cooking oil and other staples as imports languished at ports. even bottled water has been rationed. annual inflation jumped to 9. 8 in november. it is a truly unhealthy democracy that announces a voter-turnout figure lower than its headline-inflation rate.",
                "what has saved mr saied, until now, is apathy. if he cannot organise big rallies, neither can the opposition most tunisians are too disgusted with politics (and too busy trying to survive) to take to the streets in protest."

            "maintext": "F OR THE sixth time in his long career, Binyamin Netanyahu, aged 73, was sworn in as Israel’s prime minister on December 29th. But the cabinet that joined him on the front bench of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, is like no other Israeli government that has preceded it. Among the new ministers congratulating each other on the government’s inauguration was a former member of an organisation denounced for advocating terrorism who becomes Israel’s new national-security minister a finance minister who believes that following God’s commandments is the key to economic policy and a justice minister who plans to eviscerate the power of Israel’s Supreme Court, long regarded as a bastion of liberal-minded independence. It took five election campaigns in the space of four years for Mr Netanyahu, widely known as Bibi, finally to secure a solid majority in the Knesset. Following an election on November 1st, he has managed to do so thanks to a coalition agreement with far-right nationalist and ultra-religious parties. He has spent much of the past few weeks trying forlornly to convince the Israeli public, as well as Israel’s American supporters, that he will not give his new coalition partners full rein to change the nature of Israeli democracy. This may prove hard. Mr Netanyahu has not only given his hardline partners control over swathes of the Israeli government, but he has also committed himself as part of his coalition agreements to changes in legislation that include a clause to let the Knesset override rulings of the Supreme Court. He is also set to alter Israel’s anti-discrimination law so that individuals and private companies may deny services to customers whose faith or sexual orientation offends them. Mr Netanyahu’s previous governments were more moderate in composition and policies. They included centrist and sometimes left-wing parties that gave him room for manoeuvre, letting him fend off some of the more radical demands of his partners on the hard right. But this time the centrist parties, which were at the heart of the outgoing government under Yair Lapid, have refused in principle to serve under a prime minister who has been indicted on charges of corruption and bribery, and is still on trial in a Jerusalem court. Indeed, in the very week that Mr Netanyahu returned to office, witnesses for the prosecution took the stand to give evidence concerning the regulatory favours that he allegedly granted certain Israeli media owners in return for favourable coverage. It is unclear how Mr Netanyahu intends to handle his personal legal headaches. His proxies have already begun calling for the dismissal of the attorney-general, who in Israel is a civil servant. Mr Netanyahu’s allies think a more pliant successor could revisit the charges against him. Another possibility being floated by Mr Netanyahu’s friends is that the category of fraud that he is facing could be decriminalised. Even before its inauguration, the new government had already used its majority in the Knesset to appoint a member of cabinet who would previously have been barred because of prior criminal convictions. A few days before Mr Netanyahu’s team was sworn in, a law was passed to let Aryeh Deri, leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, the coalition’s second-largest, be sworn in as both interior and health minister despite his conviction earlier this year for tax fraud. Critics of Mr Netanyahu fear that this will set a precedent for the new prime minister in his bid to shake off his own troubles in court.",

Nationwide there are just 71 voter-registration centres, or one for every 216,000 people (though some mobile ones are operating ahead of a general election next year). Listen to this story.

Since 2018 Zimbabwe has collected fingerprints, photos, addresses and phone numbers to clean up the voters’ roll, which was reportedly full of \"ghost voters\". This frightens many Zimbabweans, especially those belonging to the minority Ndebele ethnic group, much of which is concentrated near Bulawayo. In 1983 some 20,000 mostly Ndebele people were massacred by the army. Emmerson Mnangagwa, now the president, was head of the security services at the time. Now, people fear data collection \"is a way to re-identify and target us,\" says Rodwin Sibanda of the Habakkuk Trust, an NGO in Bulawayo. The ruling party, Zanu- pf, is not about to perpetrate another genocide. But it has shamelessly rigged elections for two decades, and many Zimbabweans fear it could abuse their data to intimidate them. Before an election in 2018 party thugs forced people to hand over their registration slips, telling them these would reveal whom they voted for. The same thugs have in the past burned the homes of those who voted the wrong way. Zanu- pf has so ruined Zimbabwe’s economy that it cannot pay teachers or nurses, or provide food to the almost four-tenths of people in the countryside who are at risk of starving. Yet it has found the wherewithal to build a snazzy surveillance apparatus with the help of China’s communist regime. Since 2013 China has provided loans and grants worth at least $239m to help develop NetOne, Zimbabwe’s state-owned telecoms network. \"There is a huge perception that because of the proximity of the Zimbabwean government to China, much of our critical infrastructure is run by China,\" says Otto Saki, a human-rights lawyer. Technicians for Huawei, a Chinese firm, have reportedly helped state-security agents in Uganda and Zambia snoop on government critics. The government is keen to promote the idea that it is all-seeing. Take the case of Joana Mamombe, an opposition MP, and Cecilia Chimbiri, an activist, who say they were abducted and tortured by state-security agents. Mr Mnangagwa claims they are lying, arguing that the government was \"able to trace where they walked, slept and who they talked to\". Such claims are \"a clear example that the government has the necessary tools and the capacity to monitor people,\" says Nompilo Simanje of the Media Institute of Southern Africa Zimbabwe, an NGO in Harare, the capital. Moreover, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto has alleged that Zimbabwe used phone-snooping software from an affiliate of nso Group, an Israeli surveillance firm. nso says its software is meant to be used against terrorists, not activists. Police and spies in many countries use similar tools. But in most democracies, which Zimbabwe still purports to be, their power to do so is constrained by privacy laws and independent judges. Zimbabwe has neither. A purported privacy law passed by the parliament last year established a snooping centre in the president’s office with the authority to issue warrants to intercept communications. Mr Saki’s research suggests that the centre was designed by Huawei, which did not respond to questions about its involvement. Even bodies that are notionally independent have ties to the government. The electoral commission, which is run by a retired army general, has been accused of giving voters’ data to Zanu- PF, which then urged them through text messages to vote for Mr Mnangagwa. The government’s ambitions coalesce in a huge new data centre, which was built with China’s help. Its purpose is to suck up information from the government and from private firms, including banks. What this means in practice is murky. So far the state \"is not technologically savvy enough\" to implement wholesale China-style spying on dissidents, says Freeman Chari, a Zimbabwean activist. But, says Mr Chari, \"this is where we are heading. \"",

That may have been true when we were in exile and needed to retain our Jewish identity. In Israel that’s no longer the case. The second myth is that because Israel is such a tech success, with so many startups, this means that Israeli education is excellent. What we have are islands of excellence surrounded by a failing system. \"Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the element. Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKA report in October backed his gloomy prognosis. The number of trainee teachers had fallen by 38 compared with the previous year, as morale in the classroom plummeted. The government has raised teachers’ pay and made it easy to get into teacher-training college. But the number of teachers keeps falling. The profession lacks prestige. Bright young Israelis nowadays are keener to go into tech companies. Indeed, over 10 of Israel’s workforce is employed in the tech industry, perhaps the world’s highest proportion, but some doubt this will last, since Israeli children are scoring dismally in international tests. \"We’re getting serious complaints from business, academia and even the military about the level of school graduates,\" says Dalit Stauber, the education ministry’s director-general. Israel’s education system faces \"a strategic crisis\". In the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a test devised by the OECD and administered mostly to pupils in developed countries, Israel’s ranking for 15-year-olds has been steadily falling. By 2018 it was 29th out of 37 countries assessed, and even lower in maths (32nd) and science (33rd). Dan Ben-David, an economist at the Shoresh Institute in Tel Aviv, has studied the results and found still more cause to worry. If the tests applied only to Israel’s secular schools, the country would be in the rich world’s top ten. But its state-run religious schools lag far behind, and those serving Israel’s Arabic-speaking minority do even worse (see chart). \"Even these figures are misleading,\" he observes. \"They don’t include Jewish ultra-Orthodox schools, which don’t teach the national curriculum and aren’t tested by PISA. \" \"We’re constantly seeing the gaps widening among our applicants,\" says Yuval Elbashan, Dean of the Ono College, Israel’s largest private academic institution, which has large numbers of Arab and ultra-Orthodox students. \"We’re having to devote major resources just to getting new students up to standard. \" In 2020 a fifth of children started primary school in the ultra-Orthodox system. That proportion is set to grow, since the ultra-Orthodox have a high birth rate. Their political parties, which are part of the coalition that won Israel’s election on November 1st, have been promised by the incoming prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, that their schools will receive government funds, even though they ignore the national curriculum and generally refuse to teach \"secular\" subjects such as maths and English beyond a rudimentary leveland for boys only to the age of 12. After that, pupils are obliged to take exclusively religious lessons. Israel’s educational woes are not because of a lack of investment. National spending on primary and secondary education, at over 5 of GDP, is higher than in any other rich country. But its system of separate state-funded school networks for Jewish students of differing sects and for Muslim and Druze students requires a heavy and intrusive bureaucracy that hampers teachers and school heads. \"Israel isn’t the only country with a shortage of teachers or wide social gaps,\" says Adar Cohen of the Hebrew University’s School of Education. \"But the way its state school system is split into different streams is uniqueand a major source of its problems. \"This division means that curriculums, tests and teachers’ training are conducted separately. The level of funding per student in state schools, whether Jewish or Arab, is equal. But richer local authorities supplement their local schools’ funding. Wealthy parents make up for what their children do not get at school. \"Nearly everyone goes to state schools, but there’s an entire hidden industry of private tuition, paid for by parents who can afford it, which is holding up the Israeli economy,\" says Yoav Pridan, principal of a Tel Aviv high school who co-chairs the Manhigim (\"Leaders\") organisation of head teachers. \"The education ministers and director-generals are constantly changing and principals are unable to effect changes in their own schools, because we’re stuck with a politicised and centralised system,\" says Mr Pridan. There have been seven education ministers in the past decade. Ms Stauber, appointed by the outgoing government, has sought to reform teaching methods. She has given teachers incentives just to stay in the profession and granted heads more independence. She has also offered ultra-Orthodox schools extra funds if they agree to teach maths, science and English to a higher level. But she is about to leave after just a year in the job. A new minister from Mr Netanyahu’s Likud party is bound to try setting a different agenda. The outgoing team’s attempt at reform has provoked right-wing and religious criticism for supposedly forsaking traditional Bible studies. A new deputy minister representing the religious right will seek to ensure that ultra-Orthodox schools can carry on neglecting secular subjects such as maths and science. Meanwhile, the ultra-Orthodox are predicted to rise from around 12 of the population today to 25 by 2050. Without serious education reform, Israel could become a country where people know their Book of Numbers, but not their numbers or their books.",

In their first big concession since demonstrations erupted in September after the death of Mahsa Amini for not wearing a \"proper\" hijab, the clerics hinted that they are disbanding the morality police force in whose custody she died. It had been \"shut down\", said the prosecutor-general, Muhammad Jaafar Montazeri, adding that unspecified \"cultural\" methods would be adopted instead. Come mid-December, he promised, a decision would be taken on whether to abolish the mandatory hijab altogether. Listen to this story.

The morality police’s \"guidance patrol\", which combed public places to capture young women and haul them off for re-education, disappeared at the start of the unrest, once protesters began torching their vans. Millions of women have discarded their veils, sometimes burning them. Celebrities previously paid to sing the regime’s praises have followed the example of rebellious schoolgirls by appearing bareheaded. For weeks unveiled women have stridden past the security forces’ scathing eyes. \"It’s a different country,\" says a teacher, who marvelled at bareheaded women boarding flights and passing through passport controls. Now the protesters want to change or overturn Iran’s institutions and rewrite the statute books. For 43 years, keeping women veiled has been a defining symbol of the republic, epitomising its strict enforcement of sharia (Islamic law). Ruhollah Khomeini, the Islamic Republic’s founder, called it the \"flag of the revolution\". \"It’s the regime’s Berlin Wall,\" says a well-connected cleric. Knocking it down, he reckons, would \"signal the theocracy’s collapse\". The government’s men want to uphold the old code. Security guards enforce \"proper\" dress in government offices and in courts, where clerics are still sentencing scores of protesters to death. Officials threaten to shut down banks and shops that serve unveiled women. Regime voices insist that the prosecutor-general has been misunderstood. And the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, says that \"each rioter, each terrorist\", as he terms his opponents, must be punished. Since the protests began, rights groups say that some 470 people have been killed and at least 18,000 detained (see Graphic Detail). But the ruling clerics, sensing that the repression has failed to crush the unrest, are divided over what to do next. The usually hardline president, Ebrahim Raisi, speaking on December 7th at a university in Tehran, the capital, accepted \"fair criticism\" of his administration. Yet his bully boys beat up students demonstrating outside. Some security people favour replacing the morality police with smart cameras that would link unveiled women to their mobile phones and send them text messages imposing fines. But leaked transcripts of official meetings call for a lighter touch. A mouthpiece for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the regime’s praetorian guard, has suggested bringing back Muhammad Khatami, a former president censored for his reformist views, to bridge the gap between the rulers and the protesters. Even the most reactionary clerics, the theocracy’s backbone, may be wavering. Most want to keep the veil and gender segregation but question their reimposition by force. \"Khamenei is becoming a minority even among conservatives,\" says one. From his seat in neighbouring Iraq, Shia Islam’s top cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, has criticised senior Iranian clerics for damning the protesters. But it may be too late for concessions to work, anyway. Trust in the ruling clerics’ word has sunk. Many saw the prosecutor-general’s remarks as a ruse to divide the protesters. Others thought it was simply a response to the weather. The morality police normally lower their profile in Iran’s cold winters, when women cover up. Some thought the government would just give the morality police a new name. And many Iranians want more than just an end to the Islamic dress code. \"With or without the hijab, onwards the revolution,\" cried students at a polytechnic in Tehran on December 7th. Many Iranians, feeling emboldened, see the reformist clergy as a spent force and want the ayatollahs, whatever their stripe, to surrender power. The call for a three-day general strike that began on December 5th was more widely observed than earlier ones. Many shops, including in the bellwether bazaars, lowered their shutters in Tehran. Officials warned that premises joining the strike would be closed down for good, but the protesters’ threats to boycott those that stayed open made a bigger impact. Still, Iran’s pendulum has a habit of swinging wildly. In the 1930s the last shah’s secularising father banned the veil and ordered his police to rip it off women’s heads. Today’s protesters yearn for a day when, in matters of dress and much more besides, Iranians can choose for themselves.",

Last year 1,634 boda-boda drivers and their passengers died in accidents on Kenya’s roads, according to official figures. Yet their rowdy funerals are not just a sign of the dangers they face (and cause). They also mark changes in Kenyan society that, among other things, are rejigging the conventional calculus. Many older Kenyans, especially those in the countryside, keep to the old tribal ways of honouring their dead, often with the aim of pleasing ancestral spirits. Ethnic loyalty has long influenced how Kenyans have tended to vote. Governments were often in essence tribal coalitions, with leaders promising to funnel state resources into their own ethnic heartlands. Now, however, many young Kenyans are casting off old traditions and ethnic identities and are adopting new political allegiances as they move in ever larger numbers into the cities. Boda-boda drivers exemplify the trend. Cut loose from ties of village and kin, and often considered an unruly menace by the Kenyan middle class, they have formed a new brotherhood of their own.

Last year hundreds of drivers stormed a hospital and killed two suspected motorbike thieves.

But few parliamentary committees are asked to vet nominees with pasts quite so contentious as some of those proposed by William Ruto, Kenya’s new president (pictured). Take, for instance, Aisha Jumwa, Mr Ruto’s nominee for gender secretary, who has spent the past year juggling simultaneous murder and corruption trials. Or Mithika Linturi, put forward to run Kenya’s agriculture, who was charged last year with attempted rape. (Both deny all charges. )Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the element. Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKThis should be red meat for any self-respecting watchdog committee. Yet its members have seemed strangely reluctant to munch. Ms Jumwa’s legal troubles elicited only a brief mention when she appeared before them on October 18th. Others who have been in and out of trouble in the past got an even easier ride. The committee did not ask one nominee why he once threatened to sexually assault a female MP with a beer bottle and glossed over British court documents suggesting that another had taken bribes from two British businessmen jailed in 2015. Njuguna Ndung’u, the president’s treasury secretary, happily batted away politely couched questions about the scandals that marred his time as the governor of Kenya’s central bank. Kenya has a dire history of corruption and impunity. Had Mr Ruto been so minded, he could have appointed ministers with cleaner reputations. He did not. One reason is expediency. He won the election in August by a wafer and against the odds. To defeat the combined forces of his predecessor, Uhuru Kenyatta, and Raila Odinga, Mr Kenyatta’s favoured successor as president, Mr Ruto had to build a large, multi-ethnic coalition. In so doing, he accrued a fat wodge of political debt, some of it from less-than-salubrious types. Several of his cabinet choices smack of payback. Mr Ruto seems untroubled by his minions’ baggage, perhaps because he carries so much of his own. He was charged by the International Criminal Court in The Hague with orchestrating ethnic killings after a disputed election in 2007. He pleaded innocent and the trial was halted amid accusations of witness-tampering, though the judges pointedly declined to acquit him. The charges evidently did not hurt Mr Ruto when it came to the recent presidential poll. Indeed, most Kikuyu, allegedly the main victims of the killings after the election of 2007, voted enthusiastically for him. He may reckon that if voters were willing to overlook so great a scandal they would be unbothered by smaller ones, too. Unlike Mr Odinga’s campaign team, the new president’s one pointedly refused to make the fight against corruption a priority. \"For chrissakes stop whining,\" David Ndii, his chief policy strategist, wrote on Twitter last December in response to concerns about Mr Ruto’s seeming indifference to financial transparency. \"If you are looking for an anti-corruption platform don’t support us. \" Instead of \"virtue-signalling\", says Mr Ndii, the Ruto administration will deliver competent government, an end to injustice and greater prosperity for those at the bottom. Hard bargainSuch promises may raise eyebrows, given the wealth at the top. The 22 cabinet nominees who appeared before the committee declared they had a net worth of $125. 7m between them. Since the average Kenyan has a yearly income of just $2,000, this disparity might cause resentment. It should rather be a source of inspiration, says Mr Ndii, a sign that in President Ruto’s \"hustler nation\" every Kenyan will have an \"equal opportunity to be a billionaire\". So a tacit bargain is being offered to the Kenyan people forgive us our trespasses and we will deliver you from poverty. This is reflected in the Ruto administration’s early policy pronouncements. On October 4th the government lifted a ban on cultivating and importing genetically modified maize, a move that could help lower food-price inflation, which surged to 15. 5 in September. Mr Kenyatta’s petrol subsidy, which favoured richer car-owners, was swiftly ditched, but kept in place for diesel and kerosene, fuels used by the poor. Subsidies have been introduced for fertiliser in an effort to lower the price of farm inputs. Meanwhile, the government is set to launch a fund in December to ease access to credit for small businesses. Other early moves have raised cautious hopes. Mr Ruto has promptly disbanded the Special Service Unit (SSU), a police unit infamous for dispensing summary justice and clogging rivers with the corpses of its victims. The president is also trying to burnish his pro-market credentials with plans to privatise state-owned companies. Seeking to contrast himself with his predecessor, who let public debt swell alarmingly, Mr Ruto has told the treasury to cut $2. 5bn in recurrent spending. He sounds pragmatic in foreign policy, too. Whereas he was often hostile towards China in his campaign, promising to deport Chinese citizens he claimed were taking Kenyan jobs, his tone in office has become more conciliatory of late. This has not stopped him aligning with the West elsewhere, however. Kenya recently voted in the UN General Assembly to condemn Russia’s annexation of four Ukrainian regions, unlike the 18 African countries including South Africa that abstained. It did the same in the UN Security Council, where it holds a non-permanent seat. It is too soon to say whether the president is keener to serve Kenya’s people than himself and his cronies. Some suspect, for instance, that he disbanded the SSU only because it abducted two Indian members of his election-campaign team, who disappeared along with their Kenyan driver in July and have not been seen since. Some signs are worrying, however. Criminal cases against Mr Ruto’s allies are rapidly being abandoned. Mr Linturi’s attempted-rape trial collapsed after his alleged victim withdrew her complaint. The director of public prosecutions announced he was withdrawing corruption charges against Ms Jumwa, while the family of the man she allegedly murdered says it is now pursuing an out-of-court settlement. A corruption case against Rigathi Gachagua, who has not even bothered to attend his trial since he became deputy president, is also likely to be dropped. Mr Ruto’s aides insist that all these cases were trumped up by his predecessor in order to silence him. Kenyans will be praying so. But impunity today in exchange for the vague promise of prosperity tomorrow is not the deal most were hoping for.",

                "hard bargain",
                "such promises may raise eyebrows, given the wealth at the top. the 22 cabinet nominees who appeared before the committee declared they had a net worth of $125. 7m between them. since the average kenyan has a yearly income of just $2,000, this disparity might cause resentment. it should rather be a source of inspiration, says mr ndii, a sign that in president ruto’s \"hustler nation\" every kenyan will have an \"equal opportunity to be a billionaire\".",
                "so a tacit bargain is being offered to the kenyan people forgive us our trespasses and we will deliver you from poverty. this is reflected in the ruto administration’s early policy pronouncements. on october 4th the government lifted a ban on cultivating and importing genetically modified maize, a move that could help lower food-price inflation, which surged to 15. 5 in september. mr kenyatta’s petrol subsidy, which favoured richer car-owners, was swiftly ditched, but kept in place for diesel and kerosene, fuels used by the poor. subsidies have been introduced for fertiliser in an effort to lower the price of farm inputs. meanwhile, the government is set to launch a fund in december to ease access to credit for small businesses.",
                "other early moves have raised cautious hopes. mr ruto has promptly disbanded the special service unit (ssu), a police unit infamous for dispensing summary justice and clogging rivers with the corpses of its victims. the president is also trying to burnish his pro-market credentials with plans to privatise state-owned companies. seeking to contrast himself with his predecessor, who let public debt swell alarmingly, mr ruto has told the treasury to cut $2. 5bn in recurrent spending.",
                "he sounds pragmatic in foreign policy, too. whereas he was often hostile towards china in his campaign, promising to deport chinese citizens he claimed were taking kenyan jobs, his tone in office has become more conciliatory of late. this has not stopped him aligning with the west elsewhere, however. kenya recently voted in the un general assembly to condemn russia’s annexation of four ukrainian regions, unlike the 18 african countries including south africa that abstained. it did the same in the un security council, where it holds a non-permanent seat.",
                "it is too soon to say whether the president is keener to serve kenya’s people than himself and his cronies. some suspect, for instance, that he disbanded the ssu only because it abducted two indian members of his election-campaign team, who disappeared along with their kenyan driver in july and have not been seen since.",
                "some signs are worrying, however. criminal cases against mr ruto’s allies are rapidly being abandoned. mr linturi’s attempted-rape trial collapsed after his alleged victim withdrew her complaint. the director of public prosecutions announced he was withdrawing corruption charges against ms jumwa, while the family of the man she allegedly murdered says it is now pursuing an out-of-court settlement. a corruption case against rigathi gachagua, who has not even bothered to attend his trial since he became deputy president, is also likely to be dropped.",
                "mr ruto’s aides insist that all these cases were trumped up by his predecessor in order to silence him. kenyans will be praying so. but impunity today in exchange for the vague promise of prosperity tomorrow is not the deal most were hoping for."

Thanks to the country’s extreme proportional-representation system for elections, no party has ever won an outright majority in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. Intense haggling between the prospective prime minister and the parties wishing to join a coalition always follows an election. In the words of Yitzhak Rabin, an Israeli prime minister assassinated by a Jewish supremacist 27 years ago this week \"In every coalition there’s also some co-loathing. \" His adage rings true today.

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKSome of the parties hoping to form a coalition government with Binyamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, which won easily the most seats in an election on November 1st, are widely loathed. The most prominent is Itamar Ben-Gvir (portrayed above left), the leader of the Jewish Power party within a far-right bloc called Religious Zionism. He once declared, when Mr Rabin was prime minister, that he would \"get to him\". A co-leader of the bloc, Bezalel Smotrich, used the annual memorial for Rabin’s murder to air an old conspiracy theory that Israel’s security service had \"encouraged\" the assassination. A third would-be coalition partner heads a party that is fiercely homophobic. Religious Zionism is now the third-largest group in the Knesset. Mr Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, who is anxious to return to power after 17 months in opposition, needs it to secure a majority. Liberal Israelis are horrified by the prospect of Mr Ben-Gvir in government. He once led the youth wing of a virulently anti-Arab movement known as Kach, founded by an American-Israeli rabbi, Meir Kahane. From 1988 it was barred from running in Israeli elections. In 1994 it was banned by the government as a terrorist organisation. Mr Ben-Gvir has rebranded Kach as Jewish Power, toning down its rhetoric a tad. Instead of chanting \"Death to the Arabs\", his disciples are now instructed to chant \"Death to the terrorists\". \"Ben-Gvir is still inspired by Kahane and thinks like him,\" says Tomer Persico, an expert on Jewish radicalism at the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem. \"The question is whether he can put that ideology into practice. \"At the top of Mr Ben-Gvir’s list of conditions for joining the government is that he be appointed public-security minister in control of Israel’s police. Should Mr Netanyahu grant him that post, already tense relations with Israel’s Arab minority, which numbers about a fifth of the population, could further deteriorate. A frequent flashpoint is Jerusalem’s Temple Mount, where some Jewish radicals, including Mr Ben-Gvir, want to scrap the rules that prohibit Jews from praying beside the al-Aqsa mosque. Clashes there between Palestinians and the Israeli police have led in the past to violence that has spread across Israel and the Palestinian territories. Religious Zionism also hopes to pass an \"overriding\" clause that would let the Knesset countermand court rulings. That would weaken the Supreme Court’s power to block government actions and laws that curtail human rights. This change is also backed by ultra-Orthodox parties bidding to join a governing coalition under Mr Netanyahu. They have their own additional demands, including more funds for religious schools that do not teach \"secular\" subjects like mathematics. Despite his nationalist language and sniping at the courts, Mr Netanyahu in previous stints in office has refrained from rehashing the legal system. Nor has he tried to change the status quo on the Temple Mount. His previous coalitions have included parties to the left of Likud to give himself wriggle room to avoid meeting the demands of parties to his right. This time round he may be more beholden to the far right. So far no parties to his left will agree to join a coalition led by him. The two leaders of parties of the centre, the outgoing prime minister, Yair Lapid, and the defence minister, Benny Gantz, have flatly ruled out serving under a prime minister facing corruption charges, which Mr Netanyahu has battled for two years. He may by instinct lean towards a more pragmatic type of coalition, as in the past, but the far-right and religious parties are the only ones which, for the moment, will guarantee him his majority. Moreover, they might well help pass legislation that would end his trial for bribery and fraud. \"Netanyahu always ran populist campaigns, but once elected usually governed as a pragmatist,\" says Gayil Talshir of Jerusalem’s Hebrew University. \"But now, because of his trial and the coalition he’s about to form, we may indeed be about to see populism in power. \"It is not just his desire to evade justice that makes it trickier for Israeli centrists to deal with Mr Netanyahu. His party has shifted further to the right, too. Likud was always staunchly nationalist but in the past it has respected Israel’s courts and shunned Rabbi Kahane’s racism. Nowadays, however, most of Likud’s representatives support an alliance with Jewish Power and sound happy to curb the courts. Voices on the centre and left are urging Messrs Lapid and Gantz to join a government with Mr Netanyahu as the lesser of evils, to keep out the far right. So far they are refusing to do so. Meanwhile, liberal democracy in Israel is under threat.",

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKOn November 30th the rule of law became personal. A panel of ex-judges appointed by Parliament concluded there was enough evidence of misconduct by the president in relation to an odd saga involving cash inside a sofa for MP s to consider impeaching him. Over the next 24 hours he pondered resigning, in part because he felt not doing so would be hypocritical. Yet bolstered by cabinet allies and provincial bigwigs within the African National Congress (ANC), Mr Ramaphosa chose to fight and stand for re-election as leader of the ruling party at its national conference, which starts on December 16th. Mr Ramaphosa also asked South Africa’s highest court to disqualify the panel’s findings on the ground of insufficient evidence. MP s may choose to wait for that ruling before their debate on the panel’s report, scheduled for December 13th. Since a majority of MP s must vote to impeach a president, and the ANC has 57. 5 of the seats, it would require a chunk of his party to turn on him. In another twist Mr Ramaphosa’s fantastical-sounding version of the imbroglio was given a boost. Many South Africansincluding the panel membersdoubted his account of why there was $580,000 (or perhaps more) hidden in, and then stolen from, a sofa at his game farm. Mr Ramaphosa said it came from the sale of buffalo to a Sudanese businessman. On December 5th the hitherto mysterious ungulate shopper, Hazim Mustafa, told Sky News that he had indeed bought the buffalo, which he could not collect because of the pandemic. Moreover, \"$580,000 is nothing for a businessman like me. I don’t know what the big issue is,\" he added.",

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKIn an attempt to improve things, Sierra Leone is undertaking a vast but little-noted educational experiment. If it succeeds, the country could write a road map that benefits even much wealthier places. In 2018 an incoming government increased public spending on education, which is now double what it was five years ago. The number of children enrolled in its schools has risen by more than half. With more bums on seats, it is now grappling with a problem that puzzles all of Africa how to increase the woeful amount that children learn. Over the past two decades, school-enrolment rates have shot up across sub-Saharan Africa. Yet as few as one in ten children can read by the time they leave primary school (in America and Britain more than 90 can). Politicians often underestimate the scale of this crisis, or waste money on headline-grabbing projects such as computers that do not push up grades. To boost access and quality, Sierra Leone now allocates 21 of its budget on schools, one of the world’s highest rates. Much has gone on abolishing fees for tuition, exams and textbooks that many state schools had previously charged. Now almost two-thirds of youngsters are making it to senior-secondary school, up from a third. Behind his vast desk the president, Julius Maada Bio, says he has had to pinch funding from every other ministry to pay for the reforms. But he says the need for better schooling is \"existential\". The government has also tried to squelch other problems that keep youngsters from class. David Moinina Sengeh, the education minister, admits the changes are not always popular. Religious groups resent the junking of a law that had forced schools to expel pregnant schoolgirls. Teachers and parents criticise efforts to spare the cane. But Mr Sengeh, 35, a graduate of Harvard and MIT who records rap music for fun, is adored by donors. One expert ventures that he is \"the most exciting education reformer in Africa right now, and arguably around the world\". In a push to improve crummy lessons, the government has asked five organisations to compete to improve children’s marks. Each will work with about 70 primary schools for three years. The outfits, which include Save the Children and EducAid, a British charity, will not manage schools directly and cannot hire and fire teachers. But they may spend up to $36 per child on things like coaching for teachers or catch-up classes for children who have fallen behind. Successful ideas will then spread through the whole system. EducAid, for instance, has set up classes in two small halls in a field near Port Loko, a town about two hours’ drive from Freetown, the capital. Those attending it are not pupils. The 70 adults learning new ways of teaching maths are among the 600 members of staff at the schools it is working with. They will all spend time at this centre, sleeping in bunk beds at night. Trials and errorThis experiment has sparked interest not just in the potential innovations in teaching, but also because it offers a big trial of social-impact bondsa fashionable form of education finance. Donors led by Britain have set aside $18m for the trial. Most of this will be paid only after the work has been done and the exact amount will depend on how successful the organisations are at improving scores. If the results are weak, private investors who are supplying some of these outfits with working capital could walk away with a loss. The hope is that this kind of \"results-based\" financing can make education aid more effectiveand in so doing make voters in rich countries more willing to keep supporting it. The problem is that setting up these deals, and checking to see whether pay-outs have been earned, can be slow and expensive. The trial in Sierra Leone could breed confidence for more, bigger such ventures. Until now the most notable education bond on the continent has been in South Africa. It delivered investors 14 annual returns but was worth only about $2m (and did not hit all its targets for improving learning). Sierra Leone’s experiments will also inform fiery debates about free schooling. Tuition fees remain common across Africa, especially in secondary schools. Abolishing them is popular. But spending a lot more money on secondary education can be regressive in places where, because of woeful teaching, the poorest pupils drop out before they get there. In addition, free-schooling policies that are not well funded can make weak systems worse. In nearby Ghana some free senior-secondary schools are so overcrowded that pupils must take turns going to class. Yusuf, a student in Accra, the Ghanaian capital, says that his stints at home last three months at a time. Mr Sengeh acknowledges that classrooms have become more crowded since fees were abolished. \"I’d rather have 80 children in a classroom that is hot and a little noisy than 40 sitting in a spacious room and the rest under a bridge,\" he says, exaggerating class sizes somewhat to emphasise urgency \"You have to do majorreforms, all at the same time. \"Sierra Leone’s gamble on schooling faces big threats, all the same. Prices of food and fuel have been rising all around the world. Its currency, the leone, has fallen by more than 50 this year. A score of people died in the capital in August, amid violence following protests sparked by rising living costs (Mr Bio claimed, implausibly, that it was an attempt to overthrow his government). The president has promised to keep education spending high. But he must face voters again in 2023. A new government might decide that it has more urgent priorities, especially as servicing the country’s foreign debts is already chewing up about 22 of state revenues. Amid all this, the government must show that studious youngsters gain new opportunities. This year about 100,000 teenagers passed exams qualifying them for higher educationthe most ever, by some margin. But at present the country’s universities and colleges can offer places to only a fraction of them. And the reward for solving this next problem will be yet another challenge making sure these graduates can find good jobs. Reformers’ work is never done.",

In May the government announced that per diems for senior civil servants would more than double, from 120,000 shillings (about $50) to 250,000. The last detailed study, albeit from 2008-09, found that spending on allowances ($390m) was enough to pay the salaries of more than 100,000 teachers. Per diems began as justifiable payments for extra expenses. But in the 1980s and 1990s they became a way of furtively padding pay packets while governments trimmed official wages as part of structural-adjustment programmes. They have since been taken for granted. Research by Guy Blaise Nkamleu and Bernadette Dia Kamgnia for the African Development Bank notes that it is \"not uncommon\" for officials’ allowances \"to equal or exceed\" base salaries. Such largesse encourages abuse. Earlier this year the boss of Uganda’s national airline was accused of claiming $12,750 for foreign trips she never made (the airline says that in some cases she did travel and in others she paid back the allowances). Gambians are angry at how the wife of the sports minister received per diems for the recent Commonwealth Games, despite not attending the event (the minister denies any wrongdoing and says the money will be repaid). In many countries there is widespread \"leapfrogging\", where officials claim attendance at contemporaneous events, often with colleagues signing on their behalf. Even legitimate per diems undermine good government. Attendance at away days is determined by allowances, not the value of the event. Senior staff attend training meant for junior employees. Donors splurge on per diems (often paid in hard currency) so that officials bless their pet projects. They also create powerful lobbies.

Subsequent general strikes brought the country to a standstill. The next year the monarchy was overthrown. Listen to this story.

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKProtesters hope to harness similar energy this year, to oust the theocratic regime that replaced the shah all those years ago. In October, after weeks of anti-government protests across the country, staff at several oil-and-gas plants walked off the job. Workers burned tyres and blocked roads. Within weeks, however, the strikes fizzled out. Workers returned to their jobs oil exports were not disrupted. The episode was a reminder of the obstacles that face both Iran’s labour movement and the broader opposition to the regime. Nationwide protests, now in their third month, began after the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman, in the custody of Tehran’s \"morality\" police, who had accused her of wearing her veil improperly. Instead of mass rallies, the protests have become more of a cat-and-mouse game with the authorities small acts of defiance on city streets and university campuses, sometimes brutally repressed. More than 300 people, including 40 children, have been killed, according to the UN ’s human-rights chief. A Norwegian monitor puts the toll at closer to 400. Strikes have added to the turmoil. Beyond the October work stoppages, in a single week in November workers walked out of a diesel company near the capital, Tehran, and did the same at an aluminium factory in the south. Firefighters went on strike in the eastern city of Mashhad. Many shops in Tehran’s bazaar closed their doors for several days. Teachers and lorry drivers have organised their own stoppages. Yet not enough workers have joined the fray to pose a serious threat to the regime. After a decade of economic sanctions, life for many Iranians is hard. Official media acknowledge that the proportion of Iranians living on less than around $3 a day has doubled to 31 in recent years. Household spending for working-class families has dropped by 15 in the past decade. Even if many Iranians sympathise with the protesters, they simply cannot afford to strike. As in 1978, oil and related industries are crucial to the regime’s survival. Despite American sanctions, Iran managed to ship around 800,000 barrels per day in October, most of it to China. Even sold at a discount, that provides vital hard currency for a country with few other lucrative exports. But the oil-sector strikes have been short-lived. Police arrested dozens of organisers and threatened more repression. Bosses were hauled in by the authorities and told to get their workers in line. The threat of arrest and prison is not the only fear. More than half of the 205,000 workers in Iran’s petrochemical sector are on fixed-term contracts. Their jobs are precarious. They cannot easily find new ones if sacked. Trade unions are a force in Iran. In mid-2018 they held scores of protests every week. Labour unrest in 2019 was the backdrop to mass protests that November after the government announced a fuel-price rise. Now the government is cracking down on unions, arresting their leaders, crushing demonstrations and blocking sympathetic websites. And the unions are not as powerful as they were decades ago. Long-term economic changes have also weakened them. Researchers at the University of Tehran have estimated that 40-50 of Iran’s labour force works in the informal sector, with no trade bodies able to organise them.",

                "within weeks, however, the strikes fizzled out. workers returned to their jobs oil exports were not disrupted. the episode was a reminder of the obstacles that face both iran’s labour movement and the broader opposition to the regime.",
                "nationwide protests, now in their third month, began after the death of mahsa amini, a young woman, in the custody of tehran’s \"morality\" police, who had accused her of wearing her veil improperly. instead of mass rallies, the protests have become more of a cat-and-mouse game with the authorities small acts of defiance on city streets and university campuses, sometimes brutally repressed. more than 300 people, including 40 children, have been killed, according to the un ’s human-rights chief. a norwegian monitor puts the toll at closer to 400.",
                "strikes have added to the turmoil. beyond the october work stoppages, in a single week in november workers walked out of a diesel company near the capital, tehran, and did the same at an aluminium factory in the south. firefighters went on strike in the eastern city of mashhad. many shops in tehran’s bazaar closed their doors for several days. teachers and lorry drivers have organised their own stoppages.",
                "yet not enough workers have joined the fray to pose a serious threat to the regime. after a decade of economic sanctions, life for many iranians is hard. official media acknowledge that the proportion of iranians living on less than around $3 a day has doubled to 31 in recent years. household spending for working-class families has dropped by 15 in the past decade. even if many iranians sympathise with the protesters, they simply cannot afford to strike.",
                "as in 1978, oil and related industries are crucial to the regime’s survival. despite american sanctions, iran managed to ship around 800,000 barrels per day in october, most of it to china. even sold at a discount, that provides vital hard currency for a country with few other lucrative exports.",
                "but the oil-sector strikes have been short-lived. police arrested dozens of organisers and threatened more repression. bosses were hauled in by the authorities and told to get their workers in line. the threat of arrest and prison is not the only fear. more than half of the 205,000 workers in iran’s petrochemical sector are on fixed-term contracts. their jobs are precarious. they cannot easily find new ones if sacked.",
                "trade unions are a force in iran. in mid-2018 they held scores of protests every week. labour unrest in 2019 was the backdrop to mass protests that november after the government announced a fuel-price rise. now the government is cracking down on unions, arresting their leaders, crushing demonstrations and blocking sympathetic websites. and the unions are not as powerful as they were decades ago. long-term economic changes have also weakened them. researchers at the university of tehran have estimated that 40-50 of iran’s labour force works in the informal sector, with no trade bodies able to organise them."

Recently, as the country defaulted on its domestic debt, he found solace in the first book of Samuel saying \"nothing will be lost, nothing will be missing. \" Yet the Bible is a poor guide to macroeconomics. Holders of domestic bonds stand to lose a good chunk of money. Now foreign creditors are getting a buzz cut, too. On December 19th Ghana suspended interest payments to foreign creditors, in effect defaulting, pending talks. Listen to this story.

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKIt has also appealed to the high priests of economic orthodoxy, agreeing to a preliminary $3bn bail-out (about 4 of gdp) from the IMF. It needs the help. Public debt is above 100 of GDP and local and foreign interest payments eat up 70-100 of revenue, according to Mr Ofori-Atta. Inflation is running at 50 and the central bank has raised its main interest rate to 27. In past crises Ghana has wisely called in the IMF early to head off trouble and avoid spending cuts that were too painful. This time, however, it dallied for so long that austerity alone will not save it. The government blames covid-19 and surging global inflation for its pickle. Yet its troubles can also be traced to overspending, excessive borrowing and overconfidence. This is hardly new. Ghana’s governments tend to blow their budgets to win votes in election years. But recent splurges were funded largely by foreign-currency bonds, making Ghana especially vulnerable to swings in exchange rates. Nonetheless Mr Ofori-Atta was far from contrite as he announced the deal with the IMF. \"Let us all gather the harvest with joy,\" he proclaimed. He even thanked his disgraced deputy, Charles Adu Boahen, who was sacked by President Nana Akufo-Addo last month after being accused of asking for a $200,000 fee to set up a meeting with the vice-president. The triumphalism will rile long-suffering Ghanaians. Many think Mr Ofori-Atta, a cousin of the president, should himself have been fired for poor management of the economy. The fund’s deal will bring pain. But it also offers hope. It aims to slash debt to 55 of gdp in the medium term, perhaps by 2028, and the costs of servicing foreign-currency debts to 18 of government revenue. Next year’s budget includes spending cuts worth 2 of GDP. (A vast national cathedral that Mr Ofori-Atta lavished $58m of public money on will remain a stalled building site. ) Social programmes will be protected, says the fund, though some worry Mr Ofori-Atta’s promise to review them for efficiencies may be a pretext for more cuts. The agreement is already boosting confidence in Ghana’s economy. The currency, the cedi, had slumped all year but has leapt since the bail-out was announced (see chart). The government is trying to make progress on a debt restructuring, a condition of the deal. In early December Mr Ofori-Atta said the holders of domestic bonds worth 137bn cedis ($15. 2bn) should swap these for ones paying a lower rate of interest and that will be repaid over a longer period. The exchange, which was meant to be completed by December 19th, would represent a loss of about 50 of the value of the bonds, reckons J. P. Morgan, a bank. This would create a new set of problems. Ghana’s banks are heavily exposed to government debt. For some it represents more than half of total assets. A huge hit to the banking system could cause lending to plunge, which would in turn hurt the wider economy. The biggest danger will be next year, when the government’s replacement bonds will pay no interest at all, warns Ernest Addison, the governor of the Central Bank of Ghana. \"Straight away there are issues of liquidity,\" he says. Ghanaians are already pulling money out of mutual funds, says Frederick Duvor of Apakan Securities, a brokerage firm in Ghana. \"People want to salvage what’s left of their investments. \" Pension schemes will be hit, too. By the time many pensions are paid out, \"it will be worth close to nothing,\" he worries. Banks, pension funds and insurers have all demanded better terms. Last week the government blinked and extended the deadline to the end of the year. It may also tweak the scheme. Nervous policymakers are trying to prop up the banks. The central bank will loosen liquidity and capital-adequacy requirements. The government promises that a donor-backed fund worth 15bn cedis will help ensure financial stability. Mr Addison says the World Bank has committed $250m to it. All this should help. Yet when asked if he is therefore not too worried, Mr Addison simply says, \"It is early. \"Garnering debtInvestors holding $13bn of Ghana’s foreign-currency bonds will not get off lightly, either. The government has previously floated talk of a 30 cut to the face value of the debt it will repay and suspension of some interest payments. This, too, may result in a fight, though some bondholders say they expect a relatively quick deal. There are plenty of longer-term obstacles to Ghana’s recovery. Badly hit banks will not lend much for as long as it takes them to rebuild their balance-sheets. Interest rates will remain eye-watering for some time. Government spending will be austere for years.

That Ghana managed to clinch a deal with the imf in less than six months suggests its reputation as a country worth backing remains miraculously intact. Other donors are likely to follow suit. The recent surge in the cedi suggests some investors are already believers again. If the global economic picture improves, more may be tempted back. That would give Ghana a leg-up. But before it is able to emerge into this promised land of growth, its people face a painful journey. For this they blame the government, despite its repeated appeals to a higher authority.",

                "k en ofori-atta, ghana’s finance minister, is fond of invoking scripture in speeches on the economy. recently, as the country defaulted on its domestic debt, he found solace in the first book of samuel saying \"nothing will be lost, nothing will be missing. \" yet the bible is a poor guide to macroeconomics. holders of domestic bonds stand to lose a good chunk of money. now foreign creditors are getting a buzz cut, too. on december 19th ghana suspended interest payments to foreign creditors, in effect defaulting, pending talks.",

                "it has also appealed to the high priests of economic orthodoxy, agreeing to a preliminary $3bn bail-out (about 4 of gdp) from the imf. it needs the help. public debt is above 100 of gdp and local and foreign interest payments eat up 70-100 of revenue, according to mr ofori-atta. inflation is running at 50 and the central bank has raised its main interest rate to 27. in past crises ghana has wisely called in the imf early to head off trouble and avoid spending cuts that were too painful. this time, however, it dallied for so long that austerity alone will not save it.",
                "the government blames covid-19 and surging global inflation for its pickle. yet its troubles can also be traced to overspending, excessive borrowing and overconfidence. this is hardly new. ghana’s governments tend to blow their budgets to win votes in election years. but recent splurges were funded largely by foreign-currency bonds, making ghana especially vulnerable to swings in exchange rates.",
                "nonetheless mr ofori-atta was far from contrite as he announced the deal with the imf. \"let us all gather the harvest with joy,\" he proclaimed. he even thanked his disgraced deputy, charles adu boahen, who was sacked by president nana akufo-addo last month after being accused of asking for a $200,000 fee to set up a meeting with the vice-president. the triumphalism will rile long-suffering ghanaians. many think mr ofori-atta, a cousin of the president, should himself have been fired for poor management of the economy.",
                "the fund’s deal will bring pain. but it also offers hope. it aims to slash debt to 55 of gdp in the medium term, perhaps by 2028, and the costs of servicing foreign-currency debts to 18 of government revenue. next year’s budget includes spending cuts worth 2 of gdp. (a vast national cathedral that mr ofori-atta lavished $58m of public money on will remain a stalled building site. ) social programmes will be protected, says the fund, though some worry mr ofori-atta’s promise to review them for efficiencies may be a pretext for more cuts. the agreement is already boosting confidence in ghana’s economy. the currency, the cedi, had slumped all year but has leapt since the bail-out was announced (see chart). the government is trying to make progress on a debt restructuring, a condition of the deal. in early december mr ofori-atta said the holders of domestic bonds worth 137bn cedis ($15. 2bn) should swap these for ones paying a lower rate of interest and that will be repaid over a longer period. the exchange, which was meant to be completed by december 19th, would represent a loss of about 50 of the value of the bonds, reckons j. p. morgan, a bank. this would create a new set of problems. ghana’s banks are heavily exposed to government debt. for some it represents more than half of total assets. a huge hit to the banking system could cause lending to plunge, which would in turn hurt the wider economy. the biggest danger will be next year, when the government’s replacement bonds will pay no interest at all, warns ernest addison, the governor of the central bank of ghana. \"straight away there are issues of liquidity,\" he says. ghanaians are already pulling money out of mutual funds, says frederick duvor of apakan securities, a brokerage firm in ghana. \"people want to salvage what’s left of their investments. \" pension schemes will be hit, too. by the time many pensions are paid out, \"it will be worth close to nothing,\" he worries. banks, pension funds and insurers have all demanded better terms. last week the government blinked and extended the deadline to the end of the year. it may also tweak the scheme.",

Iran may be nearing that point. Swathes of the country already look like a war zone. Armoured-car columns of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the regime’s praetorian guard, roll into cities including Mahabad and Javanroud in Iran’s Kurdish north-west, firing with machineguns on protesters. Helicopters fly overhead. Circling drones broadcast martial songs. Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the element. Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKThe death toll across the country is rising sharply. Iran Human Rights, a watchdog based in Norway, reckons its tally of 342 dead in the first two months has jumped to at least 416 in the past week. The true figure could be much higher, it says, because internet blockages have interrupted the flow of information. Protesters are fighting back. \"You can’t ask a brutal dictator for your rights peacefully,\" says a Kurd, echoing the intensifying militancy. Street-fighting manuals have begun to circulate. There are increasing reports of security forces being stabbed and shot at. Supporters of the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK), based in neighbouring Iraq, say they are smuggling weapons and protective gear across the mountains into Iran. Some 60 Iranian soldiers and police have been killed, according to Iran’s state media and outside monitors. While turmoil spreads at home, Iran’s rulers are hitting backand trying to stir up troubleabroad. The IRGC is regularly firing missiles and drones at armed camps manned by Iranian exiles in Iraq’s Kurdish north. Its commanders have threatened a ground invasion. They may be signalling to other governments in the region that, were the regime to totter, it could still lash out against its enemies across the Middle East. Visitors to Kurdistan say its leaders fear that their Western allies are too preoccupied with the economic crisis and the war in Ukraine to come to their rescue. Elsewhere Iran is trying to show it can still make trouble for those who are taking cheer from its current discomfiture. It has hit an Israeli-owned tanker near the Strait of Hormuz. It has shipped parts for missiles to its Houthi allies in Yemen, who have previously struck the capitals of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The IRGC has posted a video showing how its drones could attack Saudi oil installations. Iran has also brazenly announced that it is enriching uranium at close to weapons-grade and is spinning more advanced centrifuges. \"The more the regime in Tehran is under pressure, the more it’ll lash out,\" says Christian Koch of the Gulf Research Centre Foundation in Switzerland. \"It will do whatever it takes. It’s a survival game. \" Armageddon, some fear, could beckon. Yet Iranians are also signalling to foreigners the benefits of keeping the regime on their side. The militias they have long sponsored in Iraq used to fire at the American \"occupiers\". But now that they are ensconced in the government in Baghdad, the militias are courting them. Iraq’s new prime minister, Muhammad al-Sudani, is said to have had several productive meetings with the American ambassador. Iran’s proxy in Lebanon, Hizbullah, has also tacitly engaged with America, which recently mediated an agreement between Lebanon and Israel over their maritime border. \"Iran is telling the Americans don’t miss the opportunity. ..to reach agreements you could never have dreamt of,\" says a former senior Iraqi official. Several of his colleagues think Iran is hoping that America’s deteriorating relations with Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Prince Muhammad bin Salman, may make it more open to engaging with Iran. Some hardliners in Iran’s government, including Ali Shamkhani, the national-security chief, have sought to bring reformers back into government. Official media have been quoting Muhammad Khatami, the most moderate of past presidents, after censoring him for almost a decade. A few reformers have proposed a referendum on the future type of government. Others suggest snap elections. A number of analysts think the IRGC will waive some Islamist requirements, such as women having to wear the veil, as the price for staying in power. But protesters say the regime must go, hardliners and reformers alike. Western governments are anyway unlikely to re-engage with Iran while turmoil rages within it. Technical differences between America and Europeans over nuclear negotiations have all but disappeared. Both have tired of Iran’s foot-dragging and are angered by Iran’s supply of drones to Russia for use in Ukraine. Some also question whether Iran has the ability to make good on its threats to wreak havoc abroad. Since the assassination in 2020 of Qassim Suleimani, the powerful long-serving commander of the IRGC ’s foreign strike force, many of Iran’s satellites have anyway concentrated on their own affairs rather than act as a cat’s paw for Iran’s ayatollahs. \"Even if the regime recovers, Ali Khamenei is no longer the linchpin,\" says an Iranian analyst, referring to Iran’s supreme leader. Hizbullah, too, may be constrained by Lebanon’s deal with Israel. Another Iranian protg, Hamas, the Islamist Palestinian faction running the Gaza Strip, has been relatively quiescent. The IRGC is struggling to maintain its leading position in Syria, where it is often pummelled by Israel. Now that the fighting has subsided, Syria increasingly favours ties with Arab Gulf countries that have deeper pockets. Iran is also struggling to rouse its Shia brethren in Gulf states, such as Bahrain. To the IRGC ’s ire, they mutter against the normalisation of relations with Israel under the Abraham accords, but rarely take to the streets. \"Shias no longer chant Death to America and Israel’ in Friday prayers,\" says a Shia Bahraini politician. In sum, Iran’s ayatollahs are facing an increasingly daring enemy within. Yet their friends in the region are displaying a growing reluctance to come to their aid. The Iranian regime’s struggle to survive may be becoming a lonely affair.",

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKThe two main partiesEthiopia’s government and the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF)seem to have gained almost nothing. Meanwhile, millions of inhabitants of Tigray, a region in the north, and many in the adjoining regions of Afar and Amhara (see map) have had their homes razed and their crops burned. Wide areas have been ethnically cleansed. Countless women have been raped. The peace deal called for an immediate halt to fighting between forces loyal to Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, and those supporting the TPLF. The parties also promised an unhindered flow of aid. That will offer relief to the 5m-6m civilians in Tigray who have been under blockade by government forces for most of the war. Hundreds of thousands are starving. Antnio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, called the deal a \"welcome first step\" which ought to \"bring some solace tomillions of Ethiopian civilians\". The agreement goes much further than a simple ceasefire. It sets a blueprint for future relations between Tigray and the federal government, whose \"constitutional authority\" over the region is to be restored. Federal troops are to enter Mekelle, the region’s capital, and Tigrayan forces are to be demobilised within 30 days. The government will lift its designation of the tplf as a terrorist group. An \"inclusive interim\" administration will govern the region until elections are held. In effect that will mean the dissolution of the TPLF -led regional government, elected in September 2020 in defiance of a federal government edict. It was this election that set the country on its path to war three months later when Abiy, furious at Tigray’s defiance of federal authority, massed troops on the region’s borders. This prompted a pre-emptive strike by the TPLF. Many Tigrayans think the deal amounts to a surrender. They witnessed months of murders, rapes and forced starvation in their homeland the previous time federal troops occupied it. Disbelief is palpable among those who left. \"Shock, indignation, denial, condemnation, the whole package,\" says one living elsewhere in Ethiopia. \"There’s a huge demand for the TPLF to publicly explain the deal. \" Its leaders have tersely claimed they defended Ethiopia’s constitutional order. Their reluctance to say more may be because they expect a backlash. For months the TPLF ’s top brass had insisted that their forces held the upper hand in the fighting. TPLF leaders had also promised not to concede any of their \"non-negotiable\" demands, which included the withdrawal of Eritrean troops and the return of territories annexed by the neighbouring Amhara region. In the end Eritrea, whose troops fought alongside Ethiopian government forces, did not warrant a single mention in the agreement. The status of the \"contested areas\", meanwhile, is to be resolved \"in accordance with the constitution\" (some think that could mean a referendum) at an indeterminate point in the future. That it gave up so much is probably a reflection of the TPLF ’s weakness on the battlefield and the suffering of Tigrayan civilians under the blockade. But some still think it caved too soon. One former Ethiopian diplomat reckons it made \"too many concessions\", possibly because it was under pressure from America. Speaking at a rally in southern Ethiopia on November 3rd, Abiy proclaimed \"victory\", and crowed that \"100\" of his side’s proposals had made it into the final agreement. One of his close advisers, an Orthodox Christian preacher who last year called the TPLF a \"weed\" to be wiped off the face of the earth, drew comparisons to the battle of Adwa, when Ethiopians from all corners defeated Italian invaders in 1896. Officials in the finance ministry hope that the deal will lead to the swift resumption of a much-needed IMF programme to save Ethiopia’s war-wrecked economy and unlock further donor funds for reconstruction. Yet that will depend on the ceasefire holding and the successful implementation of the peace agreement. In theory, the African Union, which convened the talks, is to act as guarantor. But it lacks teeth. \"We have to see what happens on the ground,\" says Mikiale Teklu, a Tigrayan now living abroad. \"But I don’t believe Abiy Ahmed. \"Once more unto the next breachEven if this deal marks an end to the war with Tigray, other conflicts still fester in Ethiopia. Abiy faces opposition from many in Amhara, for instance, who say they were not represented in the talks and worry that the government will eventually hand the disputed territories they occupy back to Tigray. Militias from Amhara are also at war with parts of Oromia, Abiy’s home region. And Oromia itself is racked by armed insurgency. There is little reason to think Abiy’s government is seriously considering talks with the rebels there. Ethiopia’s recent history is another reason to be cautious. The war it fought against Eritrea, which erupted in 1998 and within two years had resulted in perhaps 100,000 deaths, was supposed to have ended with a \"cessation of hostilities\" in June 2000. A peace agreement was signed within six months. It has yet to be properly implemented more than two decades later.",

On November 30th an independent panel appointed by the speaker of South Africa’s parliament said that MP s could begin impeachment proceedings against the president (pictured). Its report, authored by a retired chief justice, found \"prima facie\" evidence that the president broke the law and violated the constitution, in an odd saga involving a score of buffalo, a Sudanese businessman and hundreds of thousands of dollars stolen (by unknown thieves) from a sofa. The verdict has shocked South African politics and is deeply serious for the man who pledged to clean up South Africa after the horrendous corruption under his predecessor, Jacob Zuma. If the findings lead to the president’s ouster, it will throw the country into yet another political crisis. Mr Ramaphosa’s troubles began six months ago. On June 1st Arthur Fraser, a former spook, submitted evidence to the police that he claimed showed the president had broken various anti-corruption laws concerning the concealment and subsequent theft of large amounts of US dollars at Mr Ramaphosa’s game farm in the province of Limpopo. Opposition MP s seized on the claims and successfully asked the speaker to refer the matter to the independent panelthe potential prelude to impeachment. Mr Ramaphosa denies wrongdoing. His version of the story is that the cash taken from the sofa ($580,000, he says) came from the sale of 20 \"substandard\" buffaloes to a Sudanese businessman on Christmas Day in 2019. The money went in the sofa, he says, because it was thought to be safer than the farm’s safe. After learning of the theft a few weeks later, he reported the matter to his protection team, which is a branch of the police. The president also argues that, while he is the ultimate owner of the game farm, he is not involved in day-to-day operations, and therefore not in breach of constitutional rules regarding conflicts of interest. The independent panel conceded that Mr Fraser’s allegations contained \"hearsay\". Yet, after conducting its own preliminary inquiries, it concluded that there is sufficient evidence for MP s to investigate the case further via impeachment proceedings. Its report suggested that by seemingly combining the job of president with that of a game farmer, Mr Ramaphosa has violated the constitutional ban on cabinet ministers undertaking \"paid work\". The panel found that Mr Ramaphosa should have reported the matter to the relevant police department, not just his security team. They argue that Mr Ramaphosa may have also abused his power by seeking the help of Namibia’s president in apprehending suspects who had fled South Africa. The panel concludes that there is \"substantial doubt\" about the source and amount of money stolen. In a statement after the report was published Mr Ramaphosa again professed his innocence. Its findings, he said, represented \"an unprecedented and extraordinary moment for South Africa’s constitutional democracy\". Indeed it is no South African president has been impeached before. What happens next will take place in two related arenas. The first is the National Assembly. MP s are due to discuss the panel’s findings on December 6th and will decide on whether to go ahead with hearings. Mr Ramaphosa may launch a legal challenge against the panel, a hitherto untested constitutional mechanism. The second arena is the ANC itself. Under party rules championed by the president, officials are expected to \"step aside\" if facing criminal charges. Mr Ramaphosa has not been charged (though there is a separate police investigation), so may claim the standard does not apply in this case. Yet many in the party may use this opportunity to renew efforts to oust him at the conference this month, potentially replacing him with someone less keen on reformor tackling corruption. The South African rand fell against the dollar as markets weighed up the potential for months of instability ahead. If Mr Ramaphosa does end up going, it would be a grim end for the man who came to power offering \"a new dawn\" for South Africa. The president promised to restore due process after the kleptocratic chaos of the Zuma years and to protect the constitution he helped shape in the 1990s. It would be a sad irony if the man who vowed to restore the rule of law was ousted for breaking it.",

Two months after the death of a Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, arrested for showing her hair beneath her mandatory veil, protest art is changing cityscapes. Stencils of Amini and other women killed in the uprising plaster walls, rivalling the state’s ubiquitous murals glorifying martyrdom. Public fountains spew red dye, prompting the authorities to drain them. Stickers cover old street signs with new names. Ekbatan, a western suburb of Tehran, the capital, has been dubbed Arman after a young man shot dead in the protests. Demonstrators brandish the black flag of Islam mockingly cut into slivers like wavy hair. Girls in middle-class north Tehran sport a new style of handbag, with red splashes mimicking bullet wounds. Graffiti artists have to work fast some have been shot dead. \"It’s hard to create when the workspace is so hostile,\" explains one of them. It takes seconds to spray-paint stencils and tie paper leaves with fallen protesters’ names to trees. Iconoclasm is often quickest. Red paint spilt from rooftops streaks through the portraits of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that routinely cover the sides of housing blocks. Fading images of the regime’s founder, Ruhollah Khomeini, bleed from the eyes (see above). Traffic noise is changing too. Drivers honk horns to the rhythm of \"Death to the Dictator\", as women wave veils out of car windows. Many artists retreat online for safety. Some fashion medieval images of armies with spears surrounding a woman waving her headscarf. Others go for pop art, showing scissors cutting the Mona Lisa’s hair. Still, they are struggling to coin a logo for their revolt that spans Iran’s ethnic, religious, economic and gender divisions. Some recycle the visuals of the revolution of 1979, with Soviet-style clenched fists and broken chains. Some female artists worry about men trying to intrude on their realm. \"They say we’re all part of the patriarchy,\" complains a male artist, struggling to circulate one of his posters.",

It began life as the home of Bandali Jaffer, an Indian cotton trader. His son, a member of the first Ugandan parliament, turned it into a hotel to host a visiting pope. Then, in 1972, the dictator Idi Amin expelled the country’s 55,000 people of Indian descent and confiscated their property. The Fairway became an army base. Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the element. Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKThe expulsion, which took place over three months and culminated 50 years ago this month, was a traumatic chapter, but not the final one. Today the hotel is back in the family, managed by Mr Jaffer’s Canadian-born great-grandson Azhar. \"I never thought I would end up here,\" he says, but now \"this is home. \"On one recent evening the Fairway thronged with Indian businessmen spaghetti-dealers and biscuit-bakers, pipe-traders and detergent-makers. Most were newcomers with no memory of the old days. The Amin era was like \"a bad dream\", says Mohan Reddy from Andhra Pradesh in south India, who is busy organising an Afro-Indian investment summit \"When you wake up, you have to forget about it. \"But the \"insecurities of expulsion\" linger, to borrow the title of a forthcoming book by Anneeth Kaur Hundle, an anthropologist at the University of California, Irvine. Amin’s decree was popular with many Ugandans, who saw it as a move to \"Africanise\" the economy. For the small traders who had organised boycotts of Asian shops, it was a Pyrrhic victory the businesses of expelled Asians were dished out to soldiers and officials, who ran the country into the ground. Still, memories of the expulsion are much more ambivalent within Uganda than abroad. The outsiders insideWhen south Asians returned in the 1980s and 1990s, it was at the invitation of a new government, which was trying to rebuild the country through free markets and foreign capital. Their place in Uganda is tied to their economic identity as \"investor-citizens\", argues Ms Hundle. \"The government has really perfected ways to reincorporate Ugandan Asians and welcome new south Asiansbut still maintain them as racial outsiders,\" she says. The most prominent of the south Asians expelled in 1972 had been rich industrialists, who returned as soon as they could to reclaim their estates. But most were middling traders and shopkeepersthe dukawallaswho went on to find greener pastures in Britain and Canada. Only a few thousand returned. Their niche has been filled by newcomers from all corners of India, not just the old heartlands of Gujarat, who make up most of the 35,000 south Asians in Uganda today. Some put down roots in Uganda others see it as a stepping stone to the West. Asians run hotels, refine sugar, shape steel, fillet fish, import foodstuffs, and much else besides. They claim to contribute 60-65 of tax revenues. Most attribute their success to hard work and thrift an Indian will always carry a packed lunch rather than eat out, explains Singh Katongole, a prominent Asian leader. They also benefit from transnational ties, which link them to foreign credit. Some big-shots profited from political connections. Others cashed in during the return of expropriated properties in the 1990s, gathering up the assets of those who stayed abroad. The typecasting of Asians as \"investors\" eased their return, but it is an unstable basis for belonging. Most new migrants are professional workers or small traders, not captains of industry. In August the authorities deported more than a hundred foreigners, including Indians, Pakistanis and Chinese. Officials said the deportees had promised to build and run factories, but were instead running electronics shops. Meanwhile, big Asian business is the most visible face of local capitalismand of its inequities. Small farmers accuse south Asian-owned firms of grabbing land for sugar and palm-oil plantations. Workers complain about domineering bosses. A new history of Ugandan Asians by Samwiri Lwanga Lunyiigo, a Ugandan historian, paints south Asians as junior partners in British colonialism who today remain \"the real masters in Uganda\". That is reckless hyperbole, but a milder sense of resentment is widely felt by Ugandans. The government needs to create \"a fair ring for all the players\" or \"people will demand for a second Amin to come,\" reckons Tony Galiwango, who trades car parts in Kampala. In 2007 an Indian trader was killed by a mob, though incidents of overt racial hostility are thankfully rare. Minding their own businessThere are no Ugandan Indians in parliament. \"We’re essentially apolitical,\" argues a member of one notable family. \"Our interests are as businessmen. \" Like most investors, south Asian magnates tend to think those interests are best served by backing Yoweri Museveni, the authoritarian president since 1986. \"For government they are a resource because they have no political base in the country,\" says Mahmood Mamdani, a Ugandan Asian intellectual at Columbia University. \"All governments since independence have used this business community as a counter to local business communities, to play one off against the other. \"The outsider status of Uganda’s Asians is preserved by the constitution, which views citizenship through an ethnic lens. It lists 65 \"indigenous communities\" whose children are considered citizens by birth. Some Asian leaders are pushing for the Bahindi (\"Indians\") to be added. Legal nuances matter less than a feeling in the bones. \"Because of the expulsion there’s always a little bit of anxiety,\" says Mr Jaffer of the Fairway Hotel. Yet there is also a sense of communities rubbing along, despite the troubles of the past. Younger generations are building bridges one Asian man has 3. 3m likes for his TikTok videos of himself speaking Ugandan languages. And valued traditions remain. During the festival of Navratri a group of old-timers chat at the Patidar Samaj, one of many Indian community associations. They reminisce about their bachelor days in the 1990s, when they came to seek their fortunes, sometimes sleeping in the office behind the temple. Outside hundreds of people dance in a joyous circle, arms twirling beneath a canopy of lights. \"It is like you are in India,\" says one, as the band steps up the beat.",

It is easy to see why. Three verdant training pitches abut a small stadium complete with corporate boxes, a video-analysis suite and a briefing room for press conferences. Players as young as 12 live on the site, which also has a gym, a lyce to make sure aspiring footballers complete their schooling, and a barbershop. The players should all \"be well groomed and in the same way\", says Talla Fall, who shows your football-mad correspondent around. \"That’s part of discipline,\" he says, adding \"We have put in place everything to give the boys the best chance to perform. \"Listen to this story.

More than 15 current players, who joined the academy after extensive scouting and trials, represent Senegal in youth teams. This year Senegal’s national team, the Teranga Lions, won the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time thanks to a penalty kick from Sadio Man, Senegal’s global superstar, who was trained at Gnration Foot. That prompted a joyous countrywide street party featuring lamp-post-climbing and flame-throwing. Three players trained at Gnration Foot were named in Senegal’s World Cup squad, including Mr Man, who was recently voted the second-best player in the world. Alas, Mr Man was crocked just before the World Cup, sending Senegal into a period of anxious prayer. On November 21st the national team lost its first game to the Netherlands, which sits ten places above Senegal in the rankings of FIFA, world football’s governing body. African football is changing. For the first time all the coaches of the African teams at the World Cup are African. Women’s football is on the rise after the biggest-ever women’s Africa Cup of Nations this year. And African academies like Gnration Foot and Diambars, which has trained a host of players in the Teranga Lions, are better than many before them. Previously, many academies would be no more than \"a small house next to a pitch\", says Mr Fall. Others were like failed aid projects. In 2010 Craig Bellamy, a former striker for Wales and Liverpool, set up a academy in Sierra Leone. But it was marred by poor book-keeping and affected by Ebola. As Mr Bellamy’s income as a footballer dried up, so did the funds for the academy. It closed its doors in 2016. Gnration Foot, by contrast, has been running successfully since 2000. One reason for its strength is connections with FC Metz, a club in the French second division, which partly funds the academy and gets first pick of its talent. It usually takes two players a year to play in France. That was Mr Man’s path. If those players are then sold on to bigger clubs, as Mr Man was, Gnration Foot gets a share of the profits. Other successful African academies often have links to European clubs or backing from big business. One, Brasseries Football School in Cameroon, is backed by Castel, a French drinks firm. Yet even at Gnration Foot Mr Diaby, who was preparing to jet out to Qatar to help scout the opposition for the Teranga Lions, sees room for improvement. The gap with the best European academies has shrunk but not disappeared nine of Senegal’s squad of 26 for the World Cup are of Senegalese heritage but were born and largely trained in France. Another problem is that there are not enough high-quality facilities to turn the country’s vast pool of talent into world-class players. Right outside Gnration Foot’s compound, local youngsters play on a sloping and sandy pitch with rickety goalposts. \"Senegal is a football country,\" says Mr Diaby. \"From a young age everyone plays. \" Every year more than 1,000 local teams compete in the Nawetaan, a popular national championship for neighbourhood teams. Yet there are only two top-level academies. \"If Senegal had six or seven academies,\" says Mr Diaby wistfully, \"the results would be much better. \"",

As drivers glide north, they pass Lusail stadium, the 80,000-seat bowl that will host the World Cup final in December. It takes just another 20 minutes to reach al-Bayt stadium, where a semi-final will be played. Qatar’s promise to stage a uniquely compact World Cup has been kept football fans should have no trouble watching more than one match a day. Listen to this story.

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKIts efforts look less impressive if you turn down a narrow road soon after al-Bayt stadium. At the end sits the al-Khor \"fan village\", which promises hundreds of guests an \"enjoyable and lavish stay\" with swimming pool and restaurant. Rooms start at 1,512 rials ($415) a night. On a visit in late October, the site looked neither enjoyable nor lavishnor finished. Bulldozers worked the earth. Giant spools of cable sat along the perimeter. Perched amid an expanse of sun-baked dirt, it looked less like a deluxe resort than the sort of desert encampment where Arab regimes like to stick dissidents. The drive to al-Khor is a microcosm of Qatar’s World Cup preparations. First, the good news. The big-ticket infrastructure is ready. All eight stadiums are doneand creatively designed. Al-Bayt is styled like a nomad’s tent, while \"Stadium 974\" is a vibrant structure made from 974 recycled shipping containers (the number is Qatar’s international dialling code). Many new roads have been built. A new $36bn metro will whisk fans around town (free). Doha’s main airport, one of the world’s best, is decked out for the tournament, and the old airfield has reopened to handle overflow. By some estimates the price for all this is close to $300bn. There are less visible changes, too. Reforms to the hated kafala (sponsorship) system mean most migrant workers may change jobs or leave Qatar without their employer’s permission. The International Labour Organisation estimates the new minimum wage of 1,000 rials gave 400,000 workers a pay rise. Horror stories still abound of unpaid wages and exorbitant recruitment fees. But even many of Qatar’s critics acknowledge that the World Cup forced it to make real reforms. So far, so good. But fans need somewhere to sleep. Qatar has sold 2m room-nights at everything from five-star hotels to tent villages. Earlier this month it added another 30,000 rooms (or roughly 1m room-nights) for last-minute bookings. Omar al-Jabbar, the official in charge of accommodation, was keen to show off a traditional dhow that would serve as a floating apartment. It looked pleasant, with plush bedding and a hot tub on the top deck (and a curious number of ashtrays strewn everywhere). But there are only 30 dhows available, the largest of which sleeps ten people. Far more fans will end up at places like Barwa Barahat al-Janoub, which offers rooms for 300 rials a night. Mr Jabbar says it will accommodate 10,000 guests. \"The heavy construction is all done. They’re fitting some beds, testing the water,\" he says. \"But we can say 99 is done. \"If so, one wonders how it looked at 98. Some roads into the neighbourhood are still not paved. The booking website describes it as \"inspired by traditional Arab homes built around courtyards\". It neglects to mention that the site is ten kilometres (six miles) from the nearest metro station officials promise shuttle buses. There are no restaurants or shops for miles, though if fans get truly peckish there is a slaughterhouse across the street. Officials insist they have not overpromised \"Anything on our portal is finished, it’s ready. We upload only the things which are ready,\" says Mr Jabbar. And much can change by the time the tournament kicks off on November 20th. Workers are toiling around the clock. For now, though, many places to stay do not seem ready. Another fan village sits in a free zone near the port. Renderings show grassy pathways between colourful cabins. When your correspondent visited, it was a construction site. Dirt paths were strewn with pallets, boxes and barrels excavators were digging trenches. The only greenery in sight was piles of rolled-up Astroturf. Fans will be able to buy beer outside stadiums, but just the non-alcoholic sort inside. This is not unusual (many European countries have similar rules). Away from the stadiums, they will be able to tipple at better hotels and at \"designated areas\" organisers are cagey about where these are. Finding a spot to eat could require patience. At restaurants in souk Waqif, a popular tourist market, almost every table was full on a recent Thursday night. The same was true at the bars of West Bay, an area full of high-end hotels, and the greasy spoons in an older part of Doha. One kebab joint had a 30-minute wait. All of this worries fansand locals. Some Qataris are excited about the tournament. Others fear the traffic will be intolerable, the restaurants overflowing and the streets thronged with drunk hooligans. Schools will close for the month parents wonder how they will entertain their kids. Some plan to spend the month abroad. Quietly, some also wonder if this was all worth it. Qatar says it would have built much of this glittering infrastructure anyway, as part of its national development plan. But it has a Potemkin feel. The motorways seem too big for a country of just 3m. In fancy new malls cashiers are bored and customers scarce. Perhaps a good tournament makes Qatar a top-tier destination for tourism and big events. If it does not, at least locals heading to al-Khor will never have to worry about beach traffic.",

            "maintext": "I N SAUDI ARABIA, leaving one’s wife is a simple matter of repeating talaq (\"divorce\") three times. Perhaps thankfully, breaking up is harder to do in diplomacy. Since October 5th, when the OPEC oil cartel decided to cut production by 2m barrels per day (bpd), relations between America and Saudi Arabia have plunged to their lowest point in decades. Democrats in Washington seem determined to abandon their partner of 77 years. Gulf states are enraged by what they see as America’s sneering, disrespectful tone. Listen to this story.

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKAs in any relationship, some of the angry talk is just that. If a total rupture is unlikely, however, so too is any hope of America and its Gulf partners agreeing to kiss and make up. The oil-for-security bargain that has underpinned their relationship for decades has frayed, but no one knows what will replace it. The unhappy marriage looks likely to last for years yet. To hear it from Saudi Arabia, the OPEC cut was a technical decision. Oil markets are a mess. Prices have been on a rollercoaster. Many OPEC members were falling short of their assigned quotas. A looming rich-country recession could depress demand. The Saudis describe the cut as a pragmatic move to avoid a supply glut and keep some spare capacity in reserve. To America, however, this was an unconscionable betrayal. Joe Biden, the president, had vowed to treat the kingdom as a \"pariah\" over its murder in 2018 of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist. He reversed himself this summer, with crude at $120 a barrel, and flew to meet Muhammad bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince and de facto ruler, in his homeland. Now, less than three months later, the Saudis have orchestrated a move that could mean costlier oil. Mr Biden accused the kingdom of siding with Russia, since higher prices will pad Vladimir Putin’s treasury. \"There’s going to be some consequences,\" he growled. The claim aired by many fellow Democrats that the Saudis want to help Republicans in the coming midterms, since higher prices at the pump will hurt the administration, seems implausible in Gulf circles. Oil ministers do not make decisions about world energy markets to sway the outcome of a Senate race in Pennsylvania. Fellow oil producers have closed ranks. Bahrain and Kuwait, both OPEC members and American partners, said they agreed with the production cut. Even the United Arab Emirates (UAE) made a public show of support. The UAE often disagrees with Saudi Arabia on oil policy it wants to sell as much as it can, even on the cheap, lest its oil become a stranded asset. Yet it too insists OPEC made the right call. On the sidelines of a conference in Abu Dhabi earlier this month, one Emirati energy executive was furious about America’s response. It smacked of colonial-era rhetoric, he said. \"Who is he Who is Joe Biden\" he grumbled. \"These are our resources. \" Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati political scientist, thinks Democrats must \"wake up\" and accept that the Gulf is \"ready to say no to America\". Ali Shihabi, a less abrasive commentator close to the Saudi royal court, wondered if the kingdom might quit OPEC and form a more elite cartel. \"Saudi could easily operate without OPEC and co-ordinate production with the two or three key players privately,\" he mused. The UAE seemed to send yet another message on October 11th, when Muhammad bin Zayed, its president, flew to St Petersburg to meet Mr Putin. Emiratis say he was there to discuss a peace plan for Ukraine. Nothing solid emerged from the meeting, but that he went in person instead of making a call or sending his foreign minister was a stark reminder that the Arab world, unlike the West, refuses to take sides over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Since 1945, when Franklin Roosevelt met King Abdelaziz bin Saud aboard the USS Quincy, the Saudi-American relationship has been rooted in a simple bargain. The kingdom keeps the oil flowing America keeps the kingdom safe. Both sides now accuse the other of reneging on the deal. Yet this falling-out is rooted in mutual misunderstanding. Democrats no longer want only a reliable supply of oil they also want it at a comfortably low price. The Gulf states, meanwhile, want a more active protector. The Carter Doctrine held that America must protect its energy interests in the Middle East. For today’s Gulf monarchs, that does not mean simply policing the Strait of Hormuz. It also means leaping into action when they are threatened by Iran or its proxies. America’s dismal failure in Iraq and Afghanistan has not inspired confidence, to put it mildly. Neither side is willing to indulge the other. The Saudis and their neighbours have no wish to forgo billions in revenue to help Mr Biden’s party win a few extra votes. And most Americans, after two decades of disastrous wars in the region, would like to turn away from it. Some Gulf officials hope a second Donald Trump presidency in 2025 would tighten ties with America. Yet his wing of the Republican party is not keen to protect the Gulf petrostates. Despite its frustrations with America, the Gulf has no good alternative. Russia cannot fill a role as protector and arms supplier. With his army bogged down in Ukraine, Mr Putin needs whatever weapons his sanctions-hobbled economy can produce for his own battles. And Russia offers few prospects for trade and investment. China is a more useful partner. It does not nag about human rights. It is a big source of investment. But it has no interest in guaranteeing the Gulf’s security. Like Russia, it maintains friendly ties with the Gulf’s arch-rival, Iran. So America and the Gulf states are unhappily stuck with each otherfor now. They may disagree sharply over oil prices, the war in Ukraine and many other issues. The oil-for-security bargain is no longer a solid foundation for their relationship. But no one in Washington or Riyadh seems keen to find something that is.",

The fire began in a basement sewing workshop and spread through Evin prison, crammed with protesters detained in the past month of unrest. Guards fired tear-gas and bullets into the smoke to force back those trying to escape. They shot at prisoners who had climbed onto the roof to breatheand to chant against their jailers. Beyond Evin’s walls, Iranians in their thousands echoed their cries and honked their car horns. Listen to this story.

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKNo Iranian prison is as notorious as Evin. For 50 years it has been the holding pen, interrogation centre and gallows of the state’s political prisoners. It lies at the base of the Alborz mountains, casting a shadow over the capital below. The fire billowing inside it lit up the city and evoked the torching of the Rex Cinema, back in the summer of 1978, when the death of more than 470 people as a result of an arson attack triggered the Islamic revolution that overthrew the shah. Today’s authorities quenched the fire, quelled the protests and insisted that \"the Bastille project had failed\", a reference to the storming of the Parisian prison at the start of the French revolution of 1789. Officially only eight died in Evin. But clerics and regime loyalists, who at first ignored the protests, now openly denounce them as a movement bent on sweeping the regime aside. The mayhem in their citadel left many wondering about the strength of their hold on power. The ayatollahs initially treated the protests with cold disdain. That has given way to fevered warnings of American and Israeli plots. And the protesters, as their confidence grows, are issuing communiqus demanding a transitional government to replace the theocracy. Big events in the Middle East often have small beginnings. The Arab spring erupted after a policeman confiscated a Tunisian peddler’s cart. Last month Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, died after police detained her for improperly wearing her hijab on a trip to Tehran, the capital. \"No one thought there would be anything more than limited protests,\" says Sadegh Zibakalam, a politics professor at Tehran university. \"But the dissent hasn’t calmed down. It’s becoming like a volcano. \"The protest is led by a generation that many had assumed was too young to care, hooked on its screens and seemingly disconnected from society. Students had largely stayed out of previous bouts of unrest. But Ms Amini’s death roused a generation fuming at a fresh tightening of the dress code. This time the protesters are versed in the social norms of their peers worldwide many are hungry for a night out clubbing (not of the police-baton sort). Tired of the clerics’ insistence on gender segregation, women burn their veils, publicly cut their hair and lunch in men-only canteens in universities. They shout \"Death to the dictator\" during school-assembly renditions of loyalist hymns like \"Greetings, commander\". And in contrast to previous protests, after which many activists fled abroad, they refuse to stop in the face of water cannon, gunfire and mass arrests. \"No retreat from the government, so no retreat from the people,\" says a female student at a university in Tehran. Increasingly, traditionalists in chadors and full headscarves, who used to comprise the regime’s base, are joining the protests. Scenes of state violence against women have offended religious women steeped in Shia Islam’s narrative of martyrdom and holy struggle, says Shirin Saeidi, an expert on Iranian gender politics. Protests have spread from cosmopolitan cities to provincial towns which the clerics considered their heartland. \"We don’t want a regime that kills children,\" cried protesters in Ardabil, a quiet city 580km north-west of Tehran, after a local 16-year-old girl was reportedly beaten to death for refusing to sing a pro-regime song in her classroom. All-female universities designed to recruit the next generation of ideologues have come out in protest, too. \"Get lost\" shouted girls at al-Zahra, a women’s university favoured by the regime’s elite, when Iran’s hardline president, Ebrahim Raisi, visited. The regime seems divided over how to respond. \"One school of thought says we should have dealt with the protests more ruthlessly from the beginning to prevent them gathering pace. The other says if we’d crushed them they would only have come back more severely three months later,\" says Mr Zibakalam. \"Neither side has the upper hand. \" The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has called on establishment figures to support the security forces more whole-heartedly. But many regime insiders, including businessmen and politicians, have kept a studied silence. Some, including Ali Larijani, an influential and long-standing former speaker of parliament, have openly called for the police and the security forces to stop enforcing the mandatory veil. \"It should have a cultural solution,\" he told the official newspaper, Ettellat. Some are even siding with the protesters. \"They kicked my head and my faceThey pushed me into a vanand punched me in the face,\" Javad Mogoi, a hitherto loyalist documentary film-maker, wrote on his Instagram page, after he tried to stop the security forces beating a girl. The regime is also divided over how to respond to growing international support, albeit rhetorical, for the protests. Some favour dangling the prospect of an agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme in the hope of persuading Western governments to ease off. Others want to play up the supposed threat of foreign interference to unify the ranks at home. Mr Khamenei rails at foreign plots. His officials rattle sabres at Iran’s oil-rich neighbours, further unsettling global energy markets. The regime’s praetorian guard, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, has staged war games on the border with Azerbaijan, threatens to fire more missiles into Iraqi Kurdistan and claims to have struck the Omar oilfield, controlled by American forces in eastern Syria. \"I warn the al-Saud regime to control their media or the smoke will get into your eyes,\" said Hossein Salami, the Revolutionary Guards’ chief. As the fog grows inside the regime, the curtain of fear that has cowed the opposition seems to be lifting. Normally reticent academics are voicing acerbic criticism. A female Iranian climber has broken with state policy by competing internationally without a veil. And on October 14th a manifesto for a peaceful transition to a democratic, secular government went viral on social media. In the words of the Tehran university student, \"This time it’s the government that seems so scared. \"",

                "t he terror was worst for those trapped in solitary cells the size of tables. the fire began in a basement sewing workshop and spread through evin prison, crammed with protesters detained in the past month of unrest. guards fired tear-gas and bullets into the smoke to force back those trying to escape. they shot at prisoners who had climbed onto the roof to breatheand to chant against their jailers. beyond evin’s walls, iranians in their thousands echoed their cries and honked their car horns.",

                "no iranian prison is as notorious as evin. for 50 years it has been the holding pen, interrogation centre and gallows of the state’s political prisoners. it lies at the base of the alborz mountains, casting a shadow over the capital below. the fire billowing inside it lit up the city and evoked the torching of the rex cinema, back in the summer of 1978, when the death of more than 470 people as a result of an arson attack triggered the islamic revolution that overthrew the shah.",
                "today’s authorities quenched the fire, quelled the protests and insisted that \"the bastille project had failed\", a reference to the storming of the parisian prison at the start of the french revolution of 1789. officially only eight died in evin. but clerics and regime loyalists, who at first ignored the protests, now openly denounce them as a movement bent on sweeping the regime aside. the mayhem in their citadel left many wondering about the strength of their hold on power. the ayatollahs initially treated the protests with cold disdain. that has given way to fevered warnings of american and israeli plots. and the protesters, as their confidence grows, are issuing communiqus demanding a transitional government to replace the theocracy.",
                "big events in the middle east often have small beginnings. the arab spring erupted after a policeman confiscated a tunisian peddler’s cart. last month mahsa amini, a 22-year-old kurdish woman, died after police detained her for improperly wearing her hijab on a trip to tehran, the capital. \"no one thought there would be anything more than limited protests,\" says sadegh zibakalam, a politics professor at tehran university. \"but the dissent hasn’t calmed down. it’s becoming like a volcano. \"",
                "the protest is led by a generation that many had assumed was too young to care, hooked on its screens and seemingly disconnected from society. students had largely stayed out of previous bouts of unrest. but ms amini’s death roused a generation fuming at a fresh tightening of the dress code. this time the protesters are versed in the social norms of their peers worldwide many are hungry for a night out clubbing (not of the police-baton sort). tired of the clerics’ insistence on gender segregation, women burn their veils, publicly cut their hair and lunch in men-only canteens in universities. they shout \"death to the dictator\" during school-assembly renditions of loyalist hymns like \"greetings, commander\". and in contrast to previous protests, after which many activists fled abroad, they refuse to stop in the face of water cannon, gunfire and mass arrests. \"no retreat from the government, so no retreat from the people,\" says a female student at a university in tehran.",
                "increasingly, traditionalists in chadors and full headscarves, who used to comprise the regime’s base, are joining the protests. scenes of state violence against women have offended religious women steeped in shia islam’s narrative of martyrdom and holy struggle, says shirin saeidi, an expert on iranian gender politics. protests have spread from cosmopolitan cities to provincial towns which the clerics considered their heartland. \"we don’t want a regime that kills children,\" cried protesters in ardabil, a quiet city 580km north-west of tehran, after a local 16-year-old girl was reportedly beaten to death for refusing to sing a pro-regime song in her classroom. all-female universities designed to recruit the next generation of ideologues have come out in protest, too. \"get lost\" shouted girls at al-zahra, a women’s university favoured by the regime’s elite, when iran’s hardline president, ebrahim raisi, visited.",
                "the regime seems divided over how to respond. \"one school of thought says we should have dealt with the protests more ruthlessly from the beginning to prevent them gathering pace. the other says if we’d crushed them they would only have come back more severely three months later,\" says mr zibakalam. \"neither side has the upper hand. \" the supreme leader, ayatollah ali khamenei, has called on establishment figures to support the security forces more whole-heartedly.",
                "but many regime insiders, including businessmen and politicians, have kept a studied silence. some, including ali larijani, an influential and long-standing former speaker of parliament, have openly called for the police and the security forces to stop enforcing the mandatory veil. \"it should have a cultural solution,\" he told the official newspaper, ettellat. some are even siding with the protesters. \"they kicked my head and my facethey pushed me into a vanand punched me in the face,\" javad mogoi, a hitherto loyalist documentary film-maker, wrote on his instagram page, after he tried to stop the security forces beating a girl.",
                "the regime is also divided over how to respond to growing international support, albeit rhetorical, for the protests. some favour dangling the prospect of an agreement on iran’s nuclear programme in the hope of persuading western governments to ease off. others want to play up the supposed threat of foreign interference to unify the ranks at home. mr khamenei rails at foreign plots. his officials rattle sabres at iran’s oil-rich neighbours, further unsettling global energy markets. the regime’s praetorian guard, the islamic revolutionary guard corps, has staged war games on the border with azerbaijan, threatens to fire more missiles into iraqi kurdistan and claims to have struck the omar oilfield, controlled by american forces in eastern syria. \"i warn the al-saud regime to control their media or the smoke will get into your eyes,\" said hossein salami, the revolutionary guards’ chief.",
                "as the fog grows inside the regime, the curtain of fear that has cowed the opposition seems to be lifting. normally reticent academics are voicing acerbic criticism. a female iranian climber has broken with state policy by competing internationally without a veil. and on october 14th a manifesto for a peaceful transition to a democratic, secular government went viral on social media. in the words of the tehran university student, \"this time it’s the government that seems so scared. \""

The idea of reopening Hamas’s office and re-establishing formal ties has caused uproar in the movement. Two of its bosses, Yahya Sinwar, who was elected to lead the government of the Gaza Strip, and Ismail Haniyeh, who heads Hamas’s politburo, have backed the impending visit of a high-level Hamas delegation to Damascus. But its former political leader, Khaled Meshal, who is trying to rebuild ties with the main Sunni Arab countries, is against it. Such discussions are usually conducted in secret but have burst into the open. On September 16th Nawaf Takruri, a member of Hamas’s founding generation, used social media to attack any move towards a regime that \"continues to practise all forms of crime and murder against the Syrian and Palestinian peoples\". Hamas’s position is shaky. Within the Palestinian territories it still vies for primacy with the secular Fatah movement, which runs the West Bank under Israel’s say-so from its administrative headquarters in Ramallah, close to Jerusalem. Since bloodily wresting control of Gaza from Fatah in 2007 after winning an election two years earlier, Hamas has been isolated within its fief under a blockade imposed by both Israel and Egypt. So it has been vital for Hamas to have a headquarters outside. Few Arab countries are willing to host it. Hamas is banned in the West as a terrorist organisation. Its ideological roots in the Muslim Brotherhood, which helped inspire the revolutions that swept across the region over a decade ago, damn it in the eyes of most of the regimes of the Gulf and north Africa. To appease Egypt’s regime, Hamas agreed to renounce its allegiance to the Brotherhood, but it has struggled to regain support elsewhere in the Arab world. Since leaving Damascus, the group’s leaders have drifted mainly between Turkey and Qatar. But Turkey is mending fences with Israel, Qatar with its anti-Islamist Gulf neighbours. So Damascus may be a safer haven again. Mr Sinwar stays mostly in Gaza, with occasional sorties to Cairo. Messrs Haniyeh and Meshal are often in Qatar, sometimes in Lebanon. Before the civil war Syria allowed a degree of freedom for proclaimed \"resistance\" groups like Hamas and provided a hub where both radical Sunni and Shia movements got military and financial aid, often from Iran. Moving away from Syria meant that Hamas depended less on Iran, which remained Mr Assad’s chief backer until Russia came to his rescue in 2015. A senior Sunni cleric who died last month, Yusuf al-Qaradawi, an Egyptian Islamist based in Qatar, published a fatwa telling Sunni Muslims to fight a holy war against Mr Assad and his Iranian-backed fighters in Syria. But as Mr Assad emerged victorious from the war, some Hamas leaders have been seeking a rapprochement with him. Although Hamas on paper still seeks to win back all of Israel by arms, its followers are wary of embarking on another intifada, or uprising. Some Hamas leaders have floated the possibility of a hudna, or long-term truce with Israel, in return for lifting the blockade of Gaza. This is at the heart of the tension within Hamas over its attitude to Syria and Iran. Can it operate effectively within a region that is increasingly coming to terms with Israel, while it sticks to its radical Islamist roots",

Hotels, pubs and tourist spots are putting the last touches to fan zones that will accommodate up to 10,000 people. One of the national airlines has increased its schedule tenfold to handle the influx of visitors. A transport authority is laying on 700 taxis, dozens of buses and two ferries to move fans around town. But this is not in Qatar, the tournament’s host.

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKAn estimated 1. 2m fans are expected to visit Qatar for the show, which begins on November 20th. Not all of them will stay in Qatar, though. Some could not find affordable places to sleep (or any places at all). Others were put off by crowds or restrictions on alcohol. So several neighbouring countries stand to benefit from the cupneighbours that still had Qatar under a blockade just two years ago. The biggest winner will be Dubai, the Gulf’s most popular destination. Even at the last minute it still has plenty of rooms available. Alcohol flows in its hotels and restaurants. Tourists may also buy their own tipples at off-licences, whereas Qatar’s sole liquor store is open only to residents who have an official permit. In normal times Flydubai, the emirate’s budget carrier, operates three daily flights to Doha, Qatar’s capital. That will jump to around 30 on match days during the group stage, with Qatar Airways offering another 15 flights. Airlines in Abu Dhabi, the UAE ’s capital, and Sharjah, an emirate nearby, are also planning hundreds of extra services. The UAE is not the only country expecting a tourism boom. Saudi Arabia, which began welcoming tourists only in 2019, plans to receive tens of thousands of foreign fans. Ticket-holders will get free two-month visas to the kingdom. Ahmed al-Khateeb, the tourism minister, says there will be 240 weekly flights between Saudi Arabia and Qatar during the tournament, versus the usual six. Even sleepy Oman, which shuns mass-market tourism, expects its hotels to be busy. Saudi Arabia’s team has qualified to play in the cup, and its citizens have bought more tickets than any other nationality bar Qataris and Americans. Many plan to stay in the kingdom’s eastern province, near the border with Qatar, and drive across for matches. Qatari officials say they have expanded the crossing at Abu Samra to process 4,000 travellers an hour. This would have been impossible a few years ago. In 2017 Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE (along with Egypt) imposed an embargo on Qatar, severing travel and trade links. They demanded that Qatar cut its ties with Islamist groups, downgrade relations with Iran and generally trim the independence of its foreign policy. Qatar refused to bow. The embargo was abruptly ended last year, in part because the blockading states realised it was futile. Though Qatar is the host, many fans will experience the cup as a pan-Gulf event. Some Qataris wonder, quietly, if it would have been better to bid for a shared tournament, akin to the one in 2026, when America, Canada and Mexico will be joint hosts. By some estimates, Qatar has spent more than $200bn in preparation. Its neighbours will spend only a tiny fraction of that, yet enjoy an immediate boom. Not all of them, though. Bahrain is the nearest to Qatar, just a flight of 140km away. Yet its rulers have organised no shuttle flights or fan zones. Deep family ties link many Qataris and Bahrainis, but their governments are quarrelling over politics and territorial disputes, which sometimes trump sportand self-interest.",

Defying reports of his death, the 83-year-old celebrated the pious female athletes who had been competing abroad, shrouded in veils. One, he enthused, had refused to shake the hand of \"a foreign man\". A victorious wrestler had prostrated himself before God, reciting the names of the imams deemed holy by Shia Muslims. The athletes, he said, had scored a \"tremendous victory\" (irrespective of trophies) against Western efforts to \"export their culture and prevail over ours\". Listen to this story.

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKThe supreme guide had other reasons to feel jovial. With an eye to his succession, he had purged his regime of the reformists threatening to cast doubt on the Islamic Republic. A year earlier he had replaced President Hassan Rouhani, who earned a doctorate from a Scottish university, with Ebrahim Raisi, a little-travelled, blinkered yes-man. He had fended off Western efforts to curb Iran’s nuclear plans. Despite Western economic sanctions, Iran’s state coffers were being refilled with oil cash. And he had launched a new chastity drive bent on restoring the moral fibre of the Islamic revolution. Two days after the sporting event, Mr Khamenei’s morality police stopped Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman on a trip to Tehran, Iran’s capital, for not wearing her hijab \"properly\". They bundled her into their van and took her away for re-education and a beating. Her death in custody unleashed a decade of pent-up frustration. At the funeral women ripped off their headscarves. Police shot back with tear-gas, sparking protests that quickly spread. In scores of cities across an array of provinces they chanted Amini’s name, crying \"Death to the dictator\"the same cry that had toppled the shah in 1979. Could it happen to the ayatollahsProtests against the regime have erupted before. Big ones have occurred every decade or so, but of late have come faster and more furiously. This one has been on a very different scale. The protesters no longer demand bigger handouts or political reform within the system, but the overthrow of the theocracy. The outrage has lasted longer than before and has spread beyond the middle class. It has engulfed different religious sects and ethnicities. \"From Zahedan to Kurdistan, may my life be sacrificed for Iran,\" runs a countrywide cry, referring to a city near the eastern border with Pakistan and an Iranian province in the west. Celebrities, sporting heroes and film stars on government payrolls have cheered on the protesters. Despite hundreds of deaths and over 12,000 arrests, Mr Khamenei’s forces have failed to quell the revolt. \"We’re not a movement any more,\" says a protester at a university in Tehran. \"We’re a revolution that’s giving birth to a nation. \"For the first time in the Middle East, women have been leading the protests. They have had enough of men in turbans controlling how they must dress, travel and even work. By law, they still need male guardians to go between provinces or stay in hotels. If they have no male relative, a local mullah may have them married off. But they have increasingly seen alternative ways of life on the internet and have read of the social changes sweeping across even conservative places such as Saudi Arabia. They hear their grandparents telling them of a time before the ayatollahs when women could be judges. Their mantrazan, zindiqi, azadi (women, life, freedom)encapsulates their demands. Six weeks on, the Islamic Republic is in retreat. Women walk the streets and ride the Tehran underground without headscarves. Some raise a finger at security forces when they pass. Others offer hugs to male strangers. At Tehran’s Sharif University, male students form a line of defence against the basij, the regime’s militia of vigilantes, as women enter the male canteen. Detractors and supporters alike speak of a sexual revolution. \"For dancing in the alley. For being afraid of kissing one another,\" run the lyrics of a song, \"Baraye\", meaning \"for\", which has become the protesters’ anthem. \"For changing brains which have got rotten. For being embarrassed. For yearning for a normal life. \" \"The future of Iran is a woman,\" says Ali Karimi, a football star who fled to the United Arab Emirates and is emerging as a spokesman in exile. The protesters are mostly young many are radical. Their vanguard is drawn from university and school students, who make up around a third of Iran’s 86m-odd people. They are fired by ideas racing across social media, including khoshunat-e mashroo, or legitimate violence. They have chased Mr Khamenei’s officials out of their schools, thrown Molotov cocktails at the security forces, burned down billboards with images of the supreme leader, torn down signs of the morality police centres, and mugged lone policemen and clerics. Some of the chants mock the regime’s hate-speech \"Death to the dictator\" rather than the official \"Death to Israel\" The symbolic burning of hijabs has replaced the routine setting fire to the Stars and Stripes. When the shah was the butt of protests, the leader of the revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, famously used to intone \"When the people do not want such a servant to serve them, he should step aside. \" Now the protesters echo that saying, with Mr Khamenei as their target. That message may be swaying pious Iranians, who have been the regime’s traditional base. Some of the biggest protests have been in conservative shrine cities, such as Mashhad and Qom, and in female universities, like al-Zahra in Tehran, where the regime once trained youthful Islamic ideologues. Few have answered Mr Khamenei’s calls to mobilise. \"They’re just not showing up,\" says an Iranian analyst in Dubai. Many religious Iranians are appalled by the corruption as well as the violence perpetrated in the name of their faith. They fume at the sight of ayatollahs’ sons driving Ferraris or Porsches. Khamenei at baySo far the protesters have perhaps intentionally eschewed programmes and leaders. Their diversity makes it hard for them to agree on either. They are wary of relying on a leader who could be killed, jailed or put under house arrest, as happened to the Green Movement’s leading lights after the mass protests of 2009. Cunningly leaderlessInstead the organisation is horizontal, with hundreds of small and disparate social-media networks. They gather along main roads, not at junctions, where the riot police lie in wait. Experience has taught them that ambitious manifestos in so complex a country can be divisive. So their demands, circulated in slogans and on social-media platforms (particularly Telegram), tend be limited to calls for the release of students from jail, the trial of security men responsible for killing protesters, and the sacking of teachers who have snitched on them. The regime’s prisons may, however, be a font of revolt. \"There’s more space to talk there than in cafs,\" says an activist who spent five years in a communal cell with 90 other dissidents. \"You spend all your time thrashing through ideas with people from across Iran. We were living together and became very close. \" Fellow inmates included atheists, Shia reformists, Sunnis, Sufi mystics, Bahais, Christian converts and even jihadists loyal to Islamic State. Much as leftists and Islamists both did under the shah, they have honed their ideas and plans of action inside. They agree on equal rights and an end to discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities. In their separate jail blocks, women have done the same. On their release they have met and plotted. But this revolt has mostly been of Mr Khamenei’s own making. At its outset, the regime’s leadership was a hybrid of clergy chosen within their own councils and representatives elected by the people, albeit after being vetted for loyalty to Islamic rule. Parliament and a president were elected every four years. But during his reign of 33 years Mr Khamenei has ruled with an increasingly iron fist. His men on the Guardian Council excluded ever more candidates. Last year they fixed the presidential race so that Mr Raisi, an obedient hardliner, would win. The turnout was the republic’s lowest on record. The safety-valve of even controlled elections was discarded. Mr Khamenei purged his theocracy of reformists. The tightening of the morality code and the raising of fines for violations curbed what personal freedom Iranians still enjoyed. The regime is becoming bloodier, too. In 2009 it may have killed 70 people to suppress protests over a rigged presidential election. In 2019 it killed more than 1,500 in under a week of protests against cuts in subsidies, according to human-rights groups. The security forces have so far been loth to pour fuel on the fire by shooting schoolgirls. But the scale of repression has already exceeded that of 2009. Exhausted and overstretched, the security forces have sometimes failed to give warning shots. The regime is said to be offering the police double pay to enforce order. A massacre could turn the protests into a full-scale revolution. The regime is also ramping up its surveillance. Its thugs raid protesters’ homes to confiscate phones. \"Don’t make a fuss or we’ll take you as well,\" they say, ensuring compliance. Newly installed high-resolution cameras match pedestrians to their identity cards and mobile phones. Businessmen who have been caught flashing V -for-victory signs at protesters have been summoned for questioning in mosques. The authorities are also rolling out a countrywide intranet to seal Iran hermetically from the world wide web. VPN s that have been used to circumvent the intranet are being closed down. The authorities have reduced street lighting, plunging neighbourhoods into darkness. The regime’s most effective weapon may be economic. Few can afford to heed calls for an indefinite general strike. Inflation, at over 50, is at its highest in a decade. The currency’s value has plummeted. Millions have fallen into poverty. So the protesters’ road is long and uncertain. The largest demonstrations have numbered tens of thousands, not the millions that toppled the shah. If the revolt is to succeed, more middle-class and middle-aged Iranians need to join the fray. The security forces, police and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the regime’s praetorian body, have so far stood loyal. There have been no significant defections from the regime. But in its senior echelons a striking silence has prevailed. Despite Mr Khamenei’s call to denounce the protests, none of the former presidents has spoken up. Criticism of Mr Khamenei’s slow and rigid responses is growing in official circles. Seminarians and Islamist reformists have condemned the regime’s recourse to violence. A former long-serving speaker of parliament, Ali Larijani, has urged the regime to relax its enforcement of the hijab. The sports minister hosted a female climber who recently competed in Korea without a veil, wearing a hoodie and cap instead. There has been wrangling in the state media. Mr Khamenei has long feared concessions, seeing them as signs of weakness. \"He never budges,\" says Mohsen Kadivar, a senior theologian who now lives in America. He notes that regimes in the Middle East, such as Morocco and Jordan, that quickly amended their constitutions in the face of the Arab spring of 2011, emerged the least scathed. From Los Angeles, Reza Pahlavi, son of the last shah, has called for a referendum to decide whether Iran should be an Islamic republic, a secular one or a reconstituted monarchy. Arguments over the succession may weaken the regime from within. Mr Khamenei, who is said to have cancer, may favour his 53-year-old son, Mojtaba, who runs the supreme guide’s office and has latelyon flimsy religious groundsbeen named an ayatollah. Some clerics and generals are against a dynastic succession. In June Mr Khamenei sacked Hossein Tayeb, the Revolutionary Guards’ powerful head of intelligence, reportedly for opposing it. \"The IRGC are seeing the ground shift and are holding back,\" says Sadegh Zibakalam, a political scientist in Tehran. A former diplomat in Iran agrees. \"Maybe some of the commanders are supporting the crackdown, but the rank and file sympathise with the protesters,\" he says. The IRGC is not monolithic, in any case. Many of its senior people are motivated more by money than religion the irgc has huge business interests. Some analysts think it might sweep away the supreme guide’s establishment and impose a military rule of its own under a veneer of piety. What is certain is that Mr Khamenei and the Islamic regime are both in deeper trouble than at any time since the shah was toppled in 1979. They are dithering, unsure whether to repress more brutally or give ground. The protests could yet fizzle out, as they have before. But this time there is at least a chance that they will persist. The beginning of the end of the Islamic regime must surely be in sight.",

                "s itting on a podium before an assembly of sportsmen on september 11th, ayatollah ali khamenei, one of the world’s longest-reigning leaders, sounded surprisingly perky. defying reports of his death, the 83-year-old celebrated the pious female athletes who had been competing abroad, shrouded in veils. one, he enthused, had refused to shake the hand of \"a foreign man\". a victorious wrestler had prostrated himself before god, reciting the names of the imams deemed holy by shia muslims. the athletes, he said, had scored a \"tremendous victory\" (irrespective of trophies) against western efforts to \"export their culture and prevail over ours\".",

                "the supreme guide had other reasons to feel jovial. with an eye to his succession, he had purged his regime of the reformists threatening to cast doubt on the islamic republic. a year earlier he had replaced president hassan rouhani, who earned a doctorate from a scottish university, with ebrahim raisi, a little-travelled, blinkered yes-man. he had fended off western efforts to curb iran’s nuclear plans. despite western economic sanctions, iran’s state coffers were being refilled with oil cash. and he had launched a new chastity drive bent on restoring the moral fibre of the islamic revolution.",
                "two days after the sporting event, mr khamenei’s morality police stopped mahsa amini, a 22-year-old kurdish woman on a trip to tehran, iran’s capital, for not wearing her hijab \"properly\". they bundled her into their van and took her away for re-education and a beating. her death in custody unleashed a decade of pent-up frustration. at the funeral women ripped off their headscarves. police shot back with tear-gas, sparking protests that quickly spread. in scores of cities across an array of provinces they chanted amini’s name, crying \"death to the dictator\"the same cry that had toppled the shah in 1979. could it happen to the ayatollahs",
                "protests against the regime have erupted before. big ones have occurred every decade or so, but of late have come faster and more furiously. this one has been on a very different scale. the protesters no longer demand bigger handouts or political reform within the system, but the overthrow of the theocracy. the outrage has lasted longer than before and has spread beyond the middle class.",
                "it has engulfed different religious sects and ethnicities. \"from zahedan to kurdistan, may my life be sacrificed for iran,\" runs a countrywide cry, referring to a city near the eastern border with pakistan and an iranian province in the west. celebrities, sporting heroes and film stars on government payrolls have cheered on the protesters. despite hundreds of deaths and over 12,000 arrests, mr khamenei’s forces have failed to quell the revolt. \"we’re not a movement any more,\" says a protester at a university in tehran. \"we’re a revolution that’s giving birth to a nation. \"",
                "for the first time in the middle east, women have been leading the protests. they have had enough of men in turbans controlling how they must dress, travel and even work. by law, they still need male guardians to go between provinces or stay in hotels. if they have no male relative, a local mullah may have them married off.",
                "but they have increasingly seen alternative ways of life on the internet and have read of the social changes sweeping across even conservative places such as saudi arabia. they hear their grandparents telling them of a time before the ayatollahs when women could be judges. their mantrazan, zindiqi, azadi (women, life, freedom)encapsulates their demands.",
                "six weeks on, the islamic republic is in retreat. women walk the streets and ride the tehran underground without headscarves. some raise a finger at security forces when they pass. others offer hugs to male strangers. at tehran’s sharif university, male students form a line of defence against the basij, the regime’s militia of vigilantes, as women enter the male canteen.",
                "detractors and supporters alike speak of a sexual revolution. \"for dancing in the alley. for being afraid of kissing one another,\" run the lyrics of a song, \"baraye\", meaning \"for\", which has become the protesters’ anthem. \"for changing brains which have got rotten. for being embarrassed. for yearning for a normal life. \" \"the future of iran is a woman,\" says ali karimi, a football star who fled to the united arab emirates and is emerging as a spokesman in exile.",
                "the protesters are mostly young many are radical. their vanguard is drawn from university and school students, who make up around a third of iran’s 86m-odd people. they are fired by ideas racing across social media, including khoshunat-e mashroo, or legitimate violence. they have chased mr khamenei’s officials out of their schools, thrown molotov cocktails at the security forces, burned down billboards with images of the supreme leader, torn down signs of the morality police centres, and mugged lone policemen and clerics.",
                "some of the chants mock the regime’s hate-speech \"death to the dictator\" rather than the official \"death to israel\" the symbolic burning of hijabs has replaced the routine setting fire to the stars and stripes. when the shah was the butt of protests, the leader of the revolution, ayatollah ruhollah khomeini, famously used to intone \"when the people do not want such a servant to serve them, he should step aside. \" now the protesters echo that saying, with mr khamenei as their target.",
                "that message may be swaying pious iranians, who have been the regime’s traditional base. some of the biggest protests have been in conservative shrine cities, such as mashhad and qom, and in female universities, like al-zahra in tehran, where the regime once trained youthful islamic ideologues. few have answered mr khamenei’s calls to mobilise. \"they’re just not showing up,\" says an iranian analyst in dubai. many religious iranians are appalled by the corruption as well as the violence perpetrated in the name of their faith. they fume at the sight of ayatollahs’ sons driving ferraris or porsches.",
                "khamenei at bay",
                "so far the protesters have perhaps intentionally eschewed programmes and leaders. their diversity makes it hard for them to agree on either. they are wary of relying on a leader who could be killed, jailed or put under house arrest, as happened to the green movement’s leading lights after the mass protests of 2009.",
                "cunningly leaderless",
                "instead the organisation is horizontal, with hundreds of small and disparate social-media networks. they gather along main roads, not at junctions, where the riot police lie in wait. experience has taught them that ambitious manifestos in so complex a country can be divisive. so their demands, circulated in slogans and on social-media platforms (particularly telegram), tend be limited to calls for the release of students from jail, the trial of security men responsible for killing protesters, and the sacking of teachers who have snitched on them.",

Now a cabinet minister, he rattles off the names of places that have recently been recaptured from his erstwhile comrades. The lands of the Hawadle clan in Hiran, central Somalia \"They’ve liberated all of it. \" Almost all of the region’s key roads are also under government control. The next districts to be liberated will probably be Galguduud and Middle Shabelle (see map).

On October 29th twin car bombings in the capital, Mogadishu, killed at least 100 people. It was the country’s deadliest attack since a blast at the same place five years ago. Al-Shabab swiftly claimed credit, saying their target was the education ministry and calling it an \"enemy base\" bent on turning Somali children away from their Islamic faith. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, who has pledged \"total war\" against the jihadists since returning to office in May for his second term as president, replied that these revenge attacks showed the government is \"winning\". Though such a claim seems premature, it is true that his administration has made real strides against the jihadists in recent months. What began in the summer as a local clan revolt against al-Shabab’s increasingly onerous tax demandsamid the worst drought in four decadeshas since spread. Clan militias known as the Ma’awisley have spearheaded uprisings in several districts in Hirshabelle, one of Somalia’s five federal states. The uprisings are now being backed by the national army and by American air power. The government says ten big towns and dozens of villages are back under its control. That is sparking hope for a country that has been battling jihadists for more than 15 years. \"This is a historic offensive,\" says a senior American official. Booting the jihadists out of Hiran severs their access to the lucrative trade routes that run right down through central Somalia from the port of Bosasso in the north. It also prevents al-Shabab from using the region as a base to attack neighbouring Ethiopia as it did in July, when several hundred of its fighters crossed the border in its biggest incursion ever. Moreover, whereas most previous offensives were led by African Union troops, \"this time it’s Somali-led,\" notes Omar Mahmood of the International Crisis Group (icg), a Brussels-based think-tank focused on conflict. The president’s new approach consists of three elements military, ideological and economic. First, the federal government is providing ammunition, fuel and food to the Ma’awisley. The doughty clansmen know their terrain better than the national army and are more motivated to fight. By supporting them the president hopes to encourage a domino effect of revolts across the country, which he likens to how Iraqis eventually rid themselves of Islamic State. To this end he has also called on the presidents of Somalia’s semi-autonomous states to mobilise their own security forces against the militants. He has reportedly asked America to loosen restrictions on its drone strikes targeting al-Shabab. Meanwhile, the government is trying harder to rebut al-Shabab’s online propaganda. It is exhorting Muslim leaders to speak out against jihadism. It is also trying to squeeze the group financially by ordering businesses to rebuff its efforts at extortion. Mr Mohamud says the key lesson from his previous term as president, which ran from 2012 to 2017, is that a \"military-only approach\" does not work. In an early signal of his willingness to try new methods, the president appointed Mr Robow as minister of religious affairs. His predecessor, by contrast, had put the former al-Shabab spokesman under house arrest. \"He can be an asset,\" says Mr Mohamud. He suggests, for example, that Mr Robow could help the government \"reclaim the Islamic narrative\" from the jihadists. A more delicate but no less important task involves reaching out discreetly to former comrades and encouraging them to defect. The government’s strategy has its drawbacks. Relying on clan militias could well end badly. Though determined, the militias are ill-trained and brutal. Last month the governor of Hiran even called on them to kill the wives and mothers of al-Shabab members. Their successes may also be hard to replicate in other parts of the country. Clan militias in al-Shabab’s heartland in the south are neither as large nor as well-armed as those in Hirshabelle. And al-Shabab has a record of quickly seizing back territories that it has lost.",

The oldest of five, she scraped a living growing crops while trying to keep up with her schoolwork. But in 2020 the covid-19 pandemic struck, coming shortly after a devastating drought.

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKMs Ndlovu was one of 4,770 Zimbabwean girls to drop out of school in 2020 because of pregnancy, up from about 3,000 the year before, according to government statistics. The true number may be higher. Siqinisweyinkosi Mhlanga, who runs Orphan’s Friend, a community centre in Tsholotsho where Ms Ndlovu now spends her days, says that there may be ten times more school dropouts in her province than the official tally. In August 2020 Zimbabwe’s government amended the Education Act to prohibit schools from expelling pregnant girls, joining a growing club of African countries that are letting pregnant teenagers continue with their education. A third of Zimbabwean women marry before they are 18. Previously Zimbabwe’s education minister had described student pregnancy as a \"misdemeanour of a serious nature\", punishable by expulsion. But the amendment \"didn’t make any difference\", says Ms Mhlanga. In 2021, after teenage pregnancies rose during the covid lockdown, the number of pregnancy-related dropouts rose to 5,985, according to official statistics. Stigma and cost, rather than laws, push girls out of school. When they fall pregnant their families often \"don’t accept that girls can excel\", says Samkeliso Tshuma, the founder of The Girls Table, an NGO in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe’s second city, that promotes girls’ rights. Most girls drop out of school before teachers even know they are pregnant. The minority who persevere soon run into other barriers. When a girl called Happiness became pregnant at 15, she told her parents \"I’m not stopping school. \" They supported her until she failed her exams, a month after giving birth. They didn’t have enough money to pay for her to resit them, so she lost the chance to get the highest school-leaving certificate which would have qualified her for entry to a university. The average rural household spends $3. 23 a month on education. For Zimbabweans living below the poverty line (38 of them in 2019, up from 23 in 2011), that is quite a chunk of their income. In the first half of this year more than half of children were turned away from school because of non-payment of fees. Pregnant girls are often the first to lose out. And school can be a hostile place for them. Some complain that boys tease them, saying they smell of milk.",

This year they drew a tough bracket that included Argentina, a favourite to hoist the golden trophy. Listen to this story.

The setting may have undermined the message meeting a monarch with a ruthless reputation is not a low-pressure situation. Still, he sought to reassure. The kingdom had long-term hopes for its football programme, he said, but for now simply qualifying was victory enough. \"We hope the future is better,\" he concluded. The future came sooner than expected. On November 22nd the Saudis beat Argentina 2-1, among the greatest upsets in World Cup history. Saudi fans reacted as if they had just won the trophy itself. One widely shared video showed a Saudi man tearing the door off his home in joy (which perhaps later turned to regret). King Salman announced a national holiday on November 23rd. This year’s World Cup, in Qatar, is the first in the Middle East, a football-mad region where the local teams are often underdogs and a fractured region where rivalries too often play out on battlefields. At least for a brief period, the tournament has brought a dollop of goodwill. Since Prince Muhammad became heir-apparent in 2017, Saudi Arabia has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on sport. Some of that has gone to glitzy events, like a Formula 1 race in Jeddah and an upstart golf tour meant to compete with the PGA, that appeal to the rich and to foreigners. But the kingdom is also spending to build a pipeline of local athletes, particularly in football. For decades the Saudi royal family kept power through a Faustian pact with dour conservative clerics. Prince Muhammad has sought to sideline them, fashioning a Saudi identity that is more nationalistic and less religious. He was surely pleased to see Saudis of all stripes celebrating a national achievement. There were celebrations elsewhere, too, from Cairo to Amman to Fallujah in western Iraq. Even many Arabs who loathe Saudi Arabia’s foreign policy celebrated the win. The unlikeliest cheers came from the Houthis, the Shia rebel group in Yemen that has fought an almost eight-year war against a Saudi-led coalition. Several Houthi officials tweeted their congratulations. Though the praise was later deleted, it was perhaps a bit of football diplomacy the Saudis are desperate to end a war that has become an expensive quagmire, and there is talk that they may begin direct talks with the Houthis. When the World Cup began, on November 20th, Prince Muhammad was meant to be in Japan, the second-largest buyer of Saudi oil. Officials from both countries had worked for months to arrange the visit, which featured a meeting with the prime minister and a high-profile business forum. Days before he was to arrive, though, Prince Muhammad abruptly cancelled. Instead he flew to Doha to attend the World Cup’s opening ceremony. Five years ago Saudi Arabia led a group of four Arab countries in imposing a blockade on Qatar, long the bte noire of the Gulf over its support for Islamists and its patronage of Al Jazeera, a satellite news channel that often criticises Arab regimes (other than Qatar’s). In the early days of the embargo, there was talk of a possible Saudi invasion. State-linked newspapers in Riyadh ran lurid claims that the kingdom might dig a canal on the border, turning Qatar into an island, and perhaps build a nuclear-waste dump there to boot. All that seemed forgotten as Prince Muhammad sat smiling in the ruler’s box in Doha, two seats away from the emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. The emir returned the gesture during the Saudi-Argentina match, waving a Saudi flag from the stands and draping it around his neck. One day before the Saudi match, Iran faced off against England. Many Iranians were anxious to see if the team would make a gesture towards months of protests at home, which began in September after Mahsa Amini, a young woman, died in the custody of Iran’s \"morality\" police. Ehsan Hajsafi, the squad’s captain, had already said that he \"sympathised\" with protesters. The gesture, when it came, was a simple one when Iran’s national anthem was played in the stadium, the players stood silent rather than sing. In the hothouse environment of today’s Iran, even that proved divisive. Some thought it brave. Others saw it as a middling gesture and chanted insults at the players. The controversy overshadowed the match itself (perhaps a good thing, since Team Melli lost 6-2). Fans are fickle monarchs are mercurial. Euphoria over Saudi Arabia’s win will not end the war in Yemen, nor will silence during Iran’s anthem topple a rotten regime. The bonhomie between the crown prince and the emir could end as abruptly as it began. It is true that small gestures matter. That they matter so much in the Middle East, though, is a reminder of how divided the region is.",

                "for decades the saudi royal family kept power through a faustian pact with dour conservative clerics. prince muhammad has sought to sideline them, fashioning a saudi identity that is more nationalistic and less religious. he was surely pleased to see saudis of all stripes celebrating a national achievement. there were celebrations elsewhere, too, from cairo to amman to fallujah in western iraq. even many arabs who loathe saudi arabia’s foreign policy celebrated the win.",
                "the unlikeliest cheers came from the houthis, the shia rebel group in yemen that has fought an almost eight-year war against a saudi-led coalition. several houthi officials tweeted their congratulations. though the praise was later deleted, it was perhaps a bit of football diplomacy the saudis are desperate to end a war that has become an expensive quagmire, and there is talk that they may begin direct talks with the houthis.",
                "when the world cup began, on november 20th, prince muhammad was meant to be in japan, the second-largest buyer of saudi oil. officials from both countries had worked for months to arrange the visit, which featured a meeting with the prime minister and a high-profile business forum. days before he was to arrive, though, prince muhammad abruptly cancelled. instead he flew to doha to attend the world cup’s opening ceremony.",
                "five years ago saudi arabia led a group of four arab countries in imposing a blockade on qatar, long the bte noire of the gulf over its support for islamists and its patronage of al jazeera, a satellite news channel that often criticises arab regimes (other than qatar’s). in the early days of the embargo, there was talk of a possible saudi invasion. state-linked newspapers in riyadh ran lurid claims that the kingdom might dig a canal on the border, turning qatar into an island, and perhaps build a nuclear-waste dump there to boot.",
                "all that seemed forgotten as prince muhammad sat smiling in the ruler’s box in doha, two seats away from the emir of qatar, tamim bin hamad al-thani. the emir returned the gesture during the saudi-argentina match, waving a saudi flag from the stands and draping it around his neck.",
                "one day before the saudi match, iran faced off against england. many iranians were anxious to see if the team would make a gesture towards months of protests at home, which began in september after mahsa amini, a young woman, died in the custody of iran’s \"morality\" police. ehsan hajsafi, the squad’s captain, had already said that he \"sympathised\" with protesters.",
                "the gesture, when it came, was a simple one when iran’s national anthem was played in the stadium, the players stood silent rather than sing. in the hothouse environment of today’s iran, even that proved divisive. some thought it brave. others saw it as a middling gesture and chanted insults at the players. the controversy overshadowed the match itself (perhaps a good thing, since team melli lost 6-2).",
                "fans are fickle monarchs are mercurial. euphoria over saudi arabia’s win will not end the war in yemen, nor will silence during iran’s anthem topple a rotten regime. the bonhomie between the crown prince and the emir could end as abruptly as it began. it is true that small gestures matter. that they matter so much in the middle east, though, is a reminder of how divided the region is."

Yet Nestl, one of the world’s biggest chocolate-makers, is paying 10,000 cocoa farmers in Ivory Coast to do exactly that. Among them is Tanoh Kouadio, a 45-year-old cocoa farmer whom Nestl will pay about 67,000 west African francs ($106) to raise chickens. Listen to this story.

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKEating chocolate is one of life’s greatest pleasures. Selling it can be rather profitable. Alas, growing the beans that go into it is neither particularly profitable nor pleasurable. Most cocoa farmers are poor many of those who work for them are children. The reason that Nestl is moonlighting as a pro-poultry NGO is because it worries its customers may see chocolate as a guilty pleasure in more ways than one. Cocoa farmers’ woes are painfully clear in Ivory Coast, the world’s biggest producer. The country has roughly 1m cocoa farmers, who support about 5m people, or one-fifth of the population. More than half of Ivorian cocoa farmers and their families subsist on less than $1. 20 a day. In Ivory Coast and Ghana, which between them grow about 60 of the world’s cocoa, some 1. 5m children do dangerous work in cocoa-growing areas. Many of Ivory Coast’s forests have been destroyed to make way for cocoa trees (see map). Bars on chocolateIn 2018 Ivory Coast and Ghana agreed to set up a cartel, dubbed coPEC after the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), in a bid to push up prices. They later demanded that buyers pay a premium of $400 a tonne over the going rate (about 16 at current prices). They recently turned up the heat, saying that unless buyers began paying the higher price by November 20th, they would halt the sustainability programmes that chocolate companies run. They hope this will shame the firms in the eyes of their consumers. This is not the first time cocoa-producers have banded together. Attempts to form cartels and other price schemes began as early as 1945. Not one has worked. copec ’s recent effort is true to form. When it was first announced most big chocolate outfits, including Mars, Hershey and Mondelez (which owns Cadbury and Toblerone), loudly praised the plan. However, most big firms have subverted its spirit by paying the COPEC premium while also trimming a separate payment. This is known as the country or \"origin\" premium that goes to Ivory Coast and Ghana, ostensibly to reward their growers for reliability and quality. These cuts have largely cancelled out the feel-good copec premium. \"They say, yes, they will pay,\" fumes Yves Brahima Kon, the head of the Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC), the Ivorian regulator. \"But they don’t tell the truth. \"Ivory Coast and Ghana hope that by enlisting other producers they will get more sway over the market. Nigeria and Cameroon are talking of joining coPEC, which would raise its share of production to 75. Yet even if this time is different and copec manages to push up prices, it could struggle to sustain them. Higher prices would probably encourage more farmers to plant cocoa, further oversupplying the market. Even firms buying fair-trade cocoa at higher prices have had to stop taking on new farmers because demand for these pricier beans has lagged behind supply. Chocolate is not like oil, and not just in the sense that it tastes nicer. Saudi Arabia, the world’s swing producer of oil, can simply turn off the taps if it wants higher prices. Oil can remain underground, and does not rot. Cocoa trees, by contrast, cannot be turned off. If COPEC governments try to squeeze the market by banning exports, they will probably still have to keep buying and stockpiling beans to keep their farmers happy. Doing so could quickly overwhelm their budgets. As it is, cocoa prices are weak because there is an abundant supply. And cocoa buyers have proved adept at sidestepping the new cartel by buying beans elsewhere or running down their own stocks, according to the International Cocoa Organisation, an intergovernmental outfit. As a result, last year Ivory Coast sold its cocoa at a heavy discount. Ivorian civil-society groups say big chocolate \"made the Ivorian government bend\". Big chocolate and cocoa processors pay lip service to the premium, but prefer to publicise their own charitable programmes to help farmers. Nestl’s programme, one of many, pays farmers like Mr Kouadio not only for diversifying but also for three other worthy activities, including pruning to improve cocoa yields and sending their kids to school. Making the bitter sweetSuch programmes make for good press releases, but do not get to grips with the scale of the problem. Nestl’s project has 10,000 farmers and it plans to expand to 160,000 globally by 2030. Yet Alex Assanvo, the head of COPEC ’s secretariat, claims such programmes reach a mere 15 of its farmers. (Other estimates are higher. ) \"Sustainability programmes cannot be the answer,\" says Francesca Di Mauro, the European Union ambassador in Ivory Coast, \"they’re welcome, but they’re not systemic. \"The grim truth is that small farmers will never grow rich selling unprocessed beans. In most countries where rural folk have dramatically improved their lives, they have done so by moving to cities and finding better-paid jobs there. Encouraging them to remain in the countryside and grow more cocoa than people want to eat is an unlikely path to prosperity. Ivory Coast is hoping to move up the chocolate value chain. It is now one of the world’s two largest cocoa grinders (the other is the Netherlands). Yet grinding adds only a little of the value in a bar of chocolate. And in any case, there is little reason to think that because the country is good for growing cocoa it is also going to be better at making chocolate than, say, Belgium (which grows none). In focusing so doggedly on cocoa, Ivorians may be overlooking other industries where its firms and people might be more competitive. Farms can generate wealth, but they typically do so by becoming bigger, more efficient and more mechanised. This means having fewer farmers. Mr Kon of the Ivorian regulator thinks this is a bad idea. \"We must not change our economic model,\" he insists.",

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKHizbullah has been the most successful example of Iran’s reach across the Middle East. Since 1979 the region has been shaped by its conflict with Saudi Arabia. Iran saw several reasons to befriend regimes and cultivate proxy militias. It hoped to spread its Islamic revolution and stride forth as a defender of its Shia Muslim co-religionists. It also sought a sort of strategic depth. Some of its leaders felt a degree of Persian chauvinism towards Arabs, particularly those in the Gulf. The Gulf states, for their part, tried to push back. In the 1980s they supported Saddam Hussein’s war against Iran (he would thank them, not long after, by invading Kuwait). And they tried to boost their own allies in places like Lebanon, often with no great success. The late King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia called Iran’s regime \"the head of the snake\". The Gulf states certainly hope for a change of regime to reshape the region’s geopolitics. Saudi-funded news channels have covered the protests with lan even small demonstrations in provincial towns merit excited coverage. On the other hand, Iran’s allies are nervous. Hassan Nasrallah, Hizbullah’s leader, has derided the recent protests in Iran as a foreign plot. Yet it is hard to predict how a different Iran might look. The first question raised in Gulf circles is what kind of government would replace the clerical one. If a military regime took over, perhaps led by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, it would probably maintain support for regional proxiesif not for ideological reasons, then for strategic ones. A democratic government, by contrast, could trim Iran’s ambitions. Some Iranian protesters have chanted slogans like \"No to Gaza, No to Lebanon\", signalling hostility to the wasteful spending of billions of dollars abroad on ruthless dictators and militias. But if the ruling ayatollahs fell, their regional proxies would not collapse. Even cut off from its Iranian patrons, Hizbullah would still be Lebanon’s strongest force. Wealthy supporters and illicit businesses would still subsidise it, and the many Lebanese Shia who see it as a bulwark against Israel and a voice for a downtrodden sect would still back it. The Houthis, a Shia rebel group that controls much of Yemen, have drawn closer to Iran during an almost eight-year war against a Saudi-led coalition. But they are not just a cat’s-paw they emerged in the 1990s as a local insurgency. Though diminished, they would keep fighting. In Iraq, pro-Iranian factions often compete with other Shia groups, not over ideology but over access to the state’s oil wealth. They could wind up battling each other, whatever the nature of the regime in Tehran. The biggest shift could come in Syria. Bashar al-Assad relied on Iranian support to survive a long civil war, but he has no ideological affinity with the ayatollahs. He has tried to balance Iran with Russia. The invasion of Ukraine has made that harder Russia has withdrawn some of its troops from Syria, as they are needed elsewhere. If he could not count on either Russian or Iranian support, Mr Assad would be forced to look for new friends. He is trying to restore ties with the Gulf states, which eagerly backed the rebels who tried to overthrow him. Earlier this year he visited the United Arab Emirates, his first trip to an Arab country in a decade. If he lost his Iranian patron, he would still more eagerly crave the friendship of fellow Arabs. Gulf states had territorial and political disputes with Iran’s shah before his fall in 1979, but they found a modus vivendi with a fellow oil-exporting monarch. A more normal regime in Tehran could allow for expanded trade and investment across the Persian Gulf and could nudge Arab monarchs to cut back their lavish military spending. But that would depend on Iran curtailing its support for groups like the Houthis and militias in Iraq. The same goes for Israel, which had friendly relations with the shah’s Iran. It could have them againbut only if Iran curbed its nuclear programme and stopped backing groups such as Islamic Jihad in Gaza. Some Iranians fear an uprising in their country would end not in democracy, or even a stable military regime, but something like Syria a failed state torn apart from within. If that happened, Iran’s role could ironically be reversed. Instead of directing proxies across the region, it could find itself a playground for foreign powers. Turkey has occupied parts of Syria to push Kurdish fighters away from the border and periodically hits Kurdish targets there and in Iraq. It might do the same in an unstable Iran. The Gulf states, meanwhile, could finance and equip ethnic Arab separatists in Iran’s south-west. For now, the Gulf is revelling in the Iranian regime’s discomfort. A government that has caused so much chaos across the region now faces its own at home. But turmoil in Iran could bring unhappy consequences elsewhere. The Gulf states could look like an easy bolthole for fleeing Iranians, and the clerical regime could still urge its proxies to lash out bring us down, and we bring down the neighbourhood.",

                "the gulf states, for their part, tried to push back. in the 1980s they supported saddam hussein’s war against iran (he would thank them, not long after, by invading kuwait). and they tried to boost their own allies in places like lebanon, often with no great success.",
                "the late king abdullah of saudi arabia called iran’s regime \"the head of the snake\". the gulf states certainly hope for a change of regime to reshape the region’s geopolitics. saudi-funded news channels have covered the protests with lan even small demonstrations in provincial towns merit excited coverage. on the other hand, iran’s allies are nervous. hassan nasrallah, hizbullah’s leader, has derided the recent protests in iran as a foreign plot. yet it is hard to predict how a different iran might look. the first question raised in gulf circles is what kind of government would replace the clerical one. if a military regime took over, perhaps led by the islamic revolutionary guard corps, it would probably maintain support for regional proxiesif not for ideological reasons, then for strategic ones. a democratic government, by contrast, could trim iran’s ambitions. some iranian protesters have chanted slogans like \"no to gaza, no to lebanon\", signalling hostility to the wasteful spending of billions of dollars abroad on ruthless dictators and militias. but if the ruling ayatollahs fell, their regional proxies would not collapse. even cut off from its iranian patrons, hizbullah would still be lebanon’s strongest force. wealthy supporters and illicit businesses would still subsidise it, and the many lebanese shia who see it as a bulwark against israel and a voice for a downtrodden sect would still back it. the houthis, a shia rebel group that controls much of yemen, have drawn closer to iran during an almost eight-year war against a saudi-led coalition. but they are not just a cat’s-paw they emerged in the 1990s as a local insurgency. though diminished, they would keep fighting. in iraq, pro-iranian factions often compete with other shia groups, not over ideology but over access to the state’s oil wealth. they could wind up battling each other, whatever the nature of the regime in tehran.",
                "the biggest shift could come in syria. bashar al-assad relied on iranian support to survive a long civil war, but he has no ideological affinity with the ayatollahs. he has tried to balance iran with russia. the invasion of ukraine has made that harder russia has withdrawn some of its troops from syria, as they are needed elsewhere.",
                "if he could not count on either russian or iranian support, mr assad would be forced to look for new friends. he is trying to restore ties with the gulf states, which eagerly backed the rebels who tried to overthrow him. earlier this year he visited the united arab emirates, his first trip to an arab country in a decade. if he lost his iranian patron, he would still more eagerly crave the friendship of fellow arabs.",
                "gulf states had territorial and political disputes with iran’s shah before his fall in 1979, but they found a modus vivendi with a fellow oil-exporting monarch. a more normal regime in tehran could allow for expanded trade and investment across the persian gulf and could nudge arab monarchs to cut back their lavish military spending. but that would depend on iran curtailing its support for groups like the houthis and militias in iraq. the same goes for israel, which had friendly relations with the shah’s iran. it could have them againbut only if iran curbed its nuclear programme and stopped backing groups such as islamic jihad in gaza.",
                "some iranians fear an uprising in their country would end not in democracy, or even a stable military regime, but something like syria a failed state torn apart from within. if that happened, iran’s role could ironically be reversed. instead of directing proxies across the region, it could find itself a playground for foreign powers.",
                "turkey has occupied parts of syria to push kurdish fighters away from the border and periodically hits kurdish targets there and in iraq. it might do the same in an unstable iran. the gulf states, meanwhile, could finance and equip ethnic arab separatists in iran’s south-west.",
                "for now, the gulf is revelling in the iranian regime’s discomfort. a government that has caused so much chaos across the region now faces its own at home. but turmoil in iran could bring unhappy consequences elsewhere. the gulf states could look like an easy bolthole for fleeing iranians, and the clerical regime could still urge its proxies to lash out bring us down, and we bring down the neighbourhood."

It is a job that cannot safely be rushed. Angola has been at peace for over 20 years, yet there are still more than 1,000 uncleared minefields across the country that claim lives and stifle development. Clearing them could well take another 20 years. But advances in aerial imaging now speed things up. Drones fitted with thermal sensors or with a facility for light detection and ranging (known by its acronym, Lidar) help pinpoint minefields and mines from the air. This makes it safer and quicker to clear them on the ground. Different types of sensors suit different environments. The wide daily range of temperature in southern Angola lends itself to the thermal system, but tree cover can make it ineffective. Lidar sensors can see through the tree canopy to pick up vital clues from the ground below. \"After 30 years, things like craters and trench lines can be almost invisible,\" says Mr Nevard. \"If you flew over this with a standard camera you wouldn’t see it at all. But Lidar will map it in 3 D. That can give us a very strong idea of where the minefield is. \"Drones are not the only recent advance in de-mining. A new generation of ultra-sensitive metal detectors developed by gold-miners can spot mines buried deeper underground and those with a low metal content that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. Systems designed for the American army that combine metal detection with ground-penetrating radar are beginning to help de-mining, too. Other advances are less high-tech. A simple potato-harvesting machine is often ideal for removing anti-personnel mines from the ground. \"There’s no silver bullet that works everywhere,\" says Mr Nevard. \"It’s all about matching the tool to the threat and the terrain. But in the right conditions you can double, triple, sometimes quadruple productivity. \"However sophisticated the equipment, humans with basic tools usually complete the task of uncovering and detonating the mines. Wooden sticks mark suspected mines simple metal tools dig them out. For Angolans who have grown up under a constant threat of mines, anything that speeds up de-mining is welcome. \"We won’t be free until the mines are gone,\" says Donisa Kasanga, a farmer in her 70s who lost her leg by stepping on a mine on her way home from her fields. \"It’s like we’re living in a cage. \"",

On the side of the UN ’s annual climate conference this week in Egypt’s Sinai peninsula, a few dozen religious leaders from India to Indiana planned to pray on its summit for forgiveness for the harm humanity has been inflicting on Mother Earth. Egypt’s local military governor gave the idea a cautious welcome, hoping it might boost tourism. But his masters in Cairo were taking no chances.

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKAs climate pundits and politicians fly into the Sinai resort of Sharm el-Sheikh from all over the world to attend COP 27, Egypt’s rulers are intent on cordoning off their own environment from the debate. They have sharply restricted permits for Egyptian NGO s, installed cameras in taxis to quieten Egypt’s talkative drivers, and swamped the floor of the supposedly UN -controlled zone with plain-clothes security men wearing lapel pins. And across the country they have locked up activists seeking to hold the authorities to account for wrecking Egypt’s environment. Egyptians have a long history of protesting against environmental disasters. Prophets and peasants blamed the pharaoh for biblical famines and plagues. More recent campaigners lambasted the government of President Hosni Mubarak for approving an ammonia factory in their coastal town of Damiettaand won. And after the Arab uprising of 2011, when Mubarak was overthrown, thousands of Egyptians protested against the building of nuclear reactors, coal plants in residential areas and motorways that tore through their neighbourhoods. After the country’s top general, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, seized power in 2013, he smothered environmental dissent and pursued whatever mega-projects he fancied. \"The worse the environmental damage, the greater the silence,\" says an Egyptian activist, who, like all his ilk, requests anonymity. The greens certainly need to cry out. By 2030, according to official estimates, rising sea levels may cut agricultural output in the low-lying delta, Egypt’s breadbasket, by 30. Farmers already report falling harvests as salty water seeps into their fields. But environmental groups say they cannot conduct fieldwork or raise awareness. They face the same curbs as NGO s in other spheres. Protesters are absurdly labelled \"terrorists\" and jailed. Restrictive laws have tightened. The punishment for receiving foreign funds, which many green groups need to survive, has been amended to include sentences of death or jail for life. \"There’s no activism any more,\" laments an Egyptian environmentalist. It is unclear how many of Egypt’s estimated 65,000 political prisoners are green activists, say human-rights groups. But their number includes several prominent environmentalists. Ahmed Amasha, who helped orchestrate the Damietta protests and set up the Arab Association for Environment and Sustainable Development to train activists, has spent four of the past five years in prison. His testicles have been electrocuted and his left ribs broken, says his family. \"There’s no more respect for environmental rights than for any other in Sisi’s Egypt,\" says Mohamed Amasha, the activist’s son, who lives in America. With silence ensured, Mr Sisi’s bulldozers have speeded up the browning of green spaces in a country where 95 of the land is desert. Earlier this year he authorised the army to develop 37 islands, mostly in the Nile, that had previously been designated as conservation zones. Construction has already begun on Tawila island, off the Red Sea coast. The security forces have also begun clearing al-Warraq, a Nile island that was one of the largest green spaces remaining in Cairo, the capital. Some Egyptian greens want the conference boycotted. \"It’s just greenwashing,\" says an exiled member of the Muslim Brotherhood, the banned Islamist group, whose government Mr Sisi overthrew in 2013. \"No matter how many people are in Sisi jails, he’s showing that the whole world is there for him\" in Sharm el-Sheikh.",

The first encompasses a range of gloomy feelings that affect Algerians a sense of humiliation and oppression, a denial of dignity. This leads to the second increasingly common word, literally meaning \"those who burn\". It is applied to the growing number of Algerians wanting to emigrate illegally to get a better life abroad, involving the burning of identity papers. So far this year some 13,000 have reached Spain in rickety boats. Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the element. Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKA recent article in Le Monde, a French newspaper, headed \"Suitcase or prison\", explained why leading human-rights campaigners feel impelled to emigrate. \"I had to flee to stay alive,\" said Assa Rahmoune, a lawyer. Algerians with enough money or connections to leave legally often head for Europe, America or the Gulf. Of those who get visas to study abroad, \"90 don’t come back home,\" says a seasoned Western business visitor. (Like all foreigners and resident Algerians interviewed for this article, he requested anonymity, a telling reflection on the regime. )For the moment, three factors stifle the disgruntlement. One is the high price of gas and oil, which account for 90 of foreign-currency earnings. Europe is thirsting especially for Algeria’s abundant gas. The second is the social contract whereby the basics of lifestaple foods, electricity, cooking oil, petrol and housingare massively subsidised. This puts Algeria a shade ahead of its north African peers in the UN ’s human-development index. \"No one goes hungry,\" concedes a critic of the regime. The third is the lurking memory of dreadful bouts of nationwide violence, including the so-called dark decade. This began in 1992, when the military regime cancelled the second round of an election that Islamists were poised to win, prompting a civil war in which Algerians killed perhaps 150,000-200,000 of their compatriots. Though many people loathe the stagnation under the current set-up, and resent and fear the military-cum-security apparatus behind it, many prefer it to the chaos and bloodshed they think might ensue if the lid of repression were lifted. Aside from gas and oil, the economy is dismal. The biggest company is Sonatrach, a badly run behemoth that dominates the energy sector. Economic growth has often lagged behind the soaring population, now around 45m. And the rising domestic consumption of gas limits the scope for exporting more of it. Unemployment is around 15, and far higher for the young. A law passed in 2019 was supposed to open investment to foreigners, dropping a previous requirement that Algerian firms, generally state-run, must own more than half of any company. But Western banks and the IMF, regarded with suspicion in official Algerian circles, remain wary of entanglement. Bureaucratic obstacles, gross incompetence and a hostile attitude to foreign capital, especially French and American, still deter foreigners, though Occidental, an American oil giant, France’s TotalEnergies and Italy’s Eni signed a production-sharing deal with Sonatrach in July. Most foreign business people remain flummoxed by the new laws and their small print. It is still unclear how or whether profits may be repatriated. Other constant complaints are the seemingly random imposition of tariffs on imports (\"They slap them on whenever they like,\" says a Western investor) the reluctance to let in imports of any item that is also made in Algeria, however poor the local product’s quality the non-convertibility of the Algerian dinar, which is discounted by a third on the widely used black market and the routine need to bribe state officials to clinch a deal. Businessmen who fall foul of the authorities or of well-connected rivals often get accused of corruption or tax avoidanceand end up in jail. The requirement for ministers or senior officials to sign off on virtually any deal, plus the lethargy and incompetence of officialdom, make business extraordinarily tricky. One foreign resident reckons that 40 of requests to state bodies are never answered. Middle-ranking people \"are petrified of stepping out of line\", says another Westerner. \"You have to take it all the way to the top, otherwise things just languish for ever. Laws can change, but again and again things just never happen. \"This stultifying business environment reflects the nature of Algeria’s politics. In early 2019 peaceful street protests erupted after the ailing Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who had been president for 20 years, said he would run for a fifth term. Known as the Hirak, or Movement, the protests, which sometimes drew crowds of a million onto the streets, forced Bouteflika to step down, along with his inner circle of crooks and security men. Scores of bigwigs, including Bouteflika’s brother, past heads of the security service, two former prime ministers and a string of ministers and generals, were put in jail. Most are still there. But it soon became clear that the new regime of Abdelmadjid Tebboune, a dreary former long-serving minister under Bouteflika, was much the same as its predecessor. It has been saved only by the onset of covid-19 in 2020, which caused the Hirak to fizzle out, and by the rocketing price of gas and oil after Russia invaded Ukraine. Could a genuinely reforming, liberalising figure la Gorbachev emerge from within \"Le Pouvoir\" (\"The Power\"), as the murky circle of figures still pulling the strings is known Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, offended Mr Tebboune a year ago by aptly describing him as \"trapped\" in \"a military-political system\". Many insiders think he is little more than a figurehead. Afflicted by covid, in 2020 he disappeared from view for more than a month in Germany. Diplomats and businessmen often sigh that \"nobody really knows who’s in charge. \"Repression has again increased. Human Rights Watch counts more than 280 political prisoners a local group puts the figure at 320. A leading rights body, the Youth Action Rally, was dissolved a year ago. Foreign NGO s are virtually banned. Independent political figures and journalists are harassed and jailed, often falsely accused of conniving with one of two groups, Rachad and the Movement for the Autonomy of Kabylia (the main Berber region). The first is associated with Islamist extremism, the second with separatism both of these frighten many Algerians. The official media are pathetically sycophantic. The Western press, especially the French, is regarded as hostile. No major French newspaper has a resident French correspondent Agence France Presse’s bureau had to close down. A history professor claims with a straight face that the opposition media and the Hirak were infiltrated by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, and were often bribed by Morocco. Official pronouncements tend to be infused with a mixture of boastfulness and paranoia. Candid assessments, particularly in the French press, are furiously dismissed as racist or driven by a hate-filled desire to destabilise the countryAfrica’s largest in area. Official media are also obsessively virulent towards neighbouring Morocco, especially as the diplomatic tide may be turning against Algeria in its campaign to win independence for Western Sahara from Morocco’s occupation. The truth is that Algeria’s economy and politics are both sclerotic, its leadership repressive yet feeble, its role in Africa and the Arab world self-regarding but unappreciated it still poses as a champion of the global non-aligned movement. Many of its people, especially the young, are unhappy, frustrated and fearful of authority. Hogra prevails the haraga look for a way out. The masses who backed the Hirak have not disappeared. If the price of gas and oil were to fall precipitously, it is hard to see how this opaque yet rotten regime could survive.",

            "maintext": "S IXTEEN MONTHS after Binyamin (\"Bibi\") Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, was turfed out of office by an unwieldy coalition led by a former aide, he is on the brink of returning to power. The opinion polls suggest that his Likud party will be the largest after the election on November 1st. The right-wing and religious coalition supporting him seems to be inching towards a majority in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. Listen to this story.

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKBut it is far from certain. This is Israel’s fifth election in less than four years, after the previous four failed to yield a solid government. There may be yet another stalemate between the pro-Netanyahu bloc and the parties who refuse to join a government under a prime minister who has been indicted for fraud and bribery. \"This time will be different,\" promises Boaz Bismuth, a former newspaper editor running as a candidate for Mr Netanyahu’s right-wing party, Likud. \"The elegant explanation is that voters realise that Israel’s unprecedented economic prosperity was due to 12 years of Netanyahu in office and want him back. The less elegant explanation is they’ve seen how, in the name of anyone-but-Bibi, his rivals included even the Muslim Brotherhood in government. \"This refers to the coalition formed last year by Yair Lapid, the incumbent prime minister, who cobbled together a wobbly array of eight parties, including nationalists, centrists, left-wingers andfor the first time in Israel’s historya conservative Islamist party. Mr Lapid was so bent on forming a government that in order to ensure a majority he was prepared to let Naftali Bennett, the leader of a small right-wing party, have the first stint as the coalition’s prime minister. But the government failed to sort out its differences. After just a year in office, on June 20th Mr Bennett announced he was resigning, leaving Mr Lapid as caretaker prime minister until the coming election. A former columnist and chat-show host now aged 58, Mr Lapid has built up Yesh Atid, the centrist party he founded in 2012, to become the second-largest in the Knesset, rivalling Likud. He offers Israelis the prospect of \"normalcy\" after years of strife under Mr Netanyahu. \"Israelis are sick of waking every day to a prime minister in the headlines,\" he says. Unlike Mr Netanyahu, now 73, he has struggled to control a fractured coalition of small parties that do not easily accept his leadership. His defence minister, Benny Gantz, a 63-year-old former general, leads another centrist party and claims to have a better chance of forming a government after the election. Mr Gantz believes he can entice ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties away from the Netanyahu camp. Mr Lapid has problems on his left, too. Labour and Meretz, two of his allies, risk falling beneath the threshold of 3. 25 of the total vote that is required to win seats. Under Israel’s proportional-representation system, no single party has ever won an outright majority in the Knesset. So it is virtually impossible to become prime minister without horse-trading to form and maintain a coalition. If the small left-wing parties fail to make the cut, Mr Netanyahu could well have his majority. \"Israel needs parties with distinctive ideologies, like Labour,\" insists Naama Lazimi, who won the second spot on Labour’s slate of candidates. At 36, she stands for a new generation of Labour politicians fighting to keep the party relevant. Though it founded Israel in 1948 and was in power for half its history, voters have been steadily abandoning it, heading away from the left. \"Israeli politics has been corrupted by this never-ending dispute over Netanyahu,\" she says. \"It’s why we’ve got Lapid’s mishmash of centrism which means nothing. Someone has to be thinking about the day after Netanyahu, working to create a more equal economy and to make peace with the Palestinians. \"Whereas Mr Netanyahu has shown scant interest in accommodating the Palestinians in the territories occupied by Israel, or even Arab Israelis within the Jewish state, Mr Lapid endorsed the idea of a two-state solution in a recent speech at the UN. With America’s help he has also achieved a deal with Lebanon to demarcate the maritime border between the two countries, allowing a rich gasfield to be exploited. At the same time he buffed up his security credentials in the summer by overseeing a brief offensive against Islamic Jihad in Gaza. This week he praised his armed forces for a raid on the West Bank city of Nablus, where they killed five militants. Nonetheless, the Palestinian issue has barely featured in the campaign. Israel’s century-old conflict with the Arabs was once the main division in Israeli politics, but now the camp aligned with Mr Lapid includes right-wingers resolutely against creating a Palestinian state. This election campaign has anyway again been short of real arguments over policy. The two blocs have made crude accusations against each other. Mr Lapid’s lot warn of the \"end of democracy\" if Mr Netanyahu were to return. The right-wing religious camp laments the \"end of the Jewish state\", should Mr Lapid’s coalition prevail. Mr Netanyahu craftily engineered the merging of three small far-right parties into the Religious Zionism list. This includes Jewish Power, an intensely anti-Palestinian and Jewish supremacist party, led by Itamar Ben-Gvir, that was once on the very margin of Israeli politics. To form a coalition Mr Netanyahu may have to meet some of the ultra-nationalists’ demands for control over law enforcement. Religious Zionism has concocted a plan to change Israel’s legal system by limiting the powers of the Supreme Court, which has been sturdily independent. It also wants to abolish the \"breach of trust\" clause in criminal law, whereby many officials have been indicted. Mr Netanyahu is facing three such charges in a corruption trial that began two years ago. Simcha Rothman, a member of the Knesset from Religious Zionism who wrote the legal-reform plans, hotly denies that the intention is to get Mr Netanyahu off the hook. And religious Zionism, if the opinion polls are right, is on course to become the third-largest party. It appears to be taking votes away from Likud and Mr Netanyahu’s other religious partners. The far-right’s message is apparently resonating with young, first-time voters. With the two camps almost neck-and-neck, turnout may tip the balance. Arab Israelis, about a fifth of the population, may be crucial. In the last election, in March 2021, turnout nationwide was 67, but among Arab Israelis it was around 45 and is likely to stay the same. Last time some of the main Arab parties came together in the Joint List. But this time three Arab parties are running separately, each liable to drop below the threshold. If that happens, Mr Netanyahu’s chance of winning a majority will rise. Only a last-minute surge of Arab votes might keep him out.",

The landscape shifts from earthly desert to Mars-red dunes, then to moonscape as the chopper nears Luderitz. In the early 1900s this tiny port was the hub for a diamond boom that brought the art-nouveau mansions that perch on the town’s slopes. More than a century on, Namibia hopes that the area will again bring riches, this time from sun, wind and land, by hosting one of Africa’s largest renewable-energy projects. Listen to this story.

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKThe plan is that solar plants and wind turbines will provide power to split water into oxygen and \"green\" hydrogen to make ammonia, an important industrial chemical. James Mnyupe, an adviser to Namibia’s president, struck a deal last year with Namibia’s preferred developer, Hyphen, a German-led consortium. It could lead to an investment of $9. 4bna huge boost for a country with a GDP of about $12bn. Namibia’s green-hydrogen project is symbolic of the optimism about renewable energy in Africa. Many hope that the continent will \"leapfrog\" past fossil fuels. Alas, things are not so simple. In the rich world the big energy challenge is how to make the supply cleaner. In Africa the problem is how to generate more energy. Average consumption per person in sub-Saharan Africa, excluding South Africa, is a mere 185 kilowatt-hours (kWh) a year, compared with about 6,500kWh in Europe and 12,700kWh in America. An American fridge uses more electricity than a typical African person. Low energy use is a consequence of poverty but it is also a cause of it. If Africa is to grow richer it will need to use a lot more energy, including fossil fuels. Yet its efforts to do so put it on a collision course with hypocritical rich countries. The rich world is happy to import fossil fuels for its own use, while at the same time restricting public financing for African gas projects intended for domestic use. \"Is the West saying Africa should remain undeveloped\" fumes Matthew Opoku Prempeh, Ghana’s energy minister. To be sure, clean-energy technologies are a huge opportunity for the continent. They are already the main sources of power for 22 of Africa’s 54 countries. But to hope that Africa can rely on renewables alone to boost consumption is naive. Take electricity, a source of power that is still not available to some 590m people, or about half of sub-Saharan Africans. What electricity there is, is unreliable and costly. Adjusted for purchasing power, households in many African countries pay higher rates than those in the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries. In research published in 2019, Energy for Growth, a think-tank, noted that 78 of African firms experienced power cuts in the past year, while 41 said that electricity was a major constraint. Many businesses and well-off households rely on generators. These have more total capacity than there is in sub-Saharan Africa’s installed renewables. In a report published in June the International Energy Agency (iea) pointed out that if Africa is to provide universal electricity access by 2030 it would have to almost double its total generation capacity from 260 GW (currently 3 of the global total) to 510 GW. Renewables could provide 80 of the increase, it reckons. Achieving that would be a mammoth task. Africa is home to 18 of humanity, yet receives less than 5 of global energy investment. Much of this tends to go on producing oil and gas for export. The IEA thinks that total capital spending on energy between 2026 and 2030 in Africa would have to be nearly twice what it was between 2016 and 2020. Investment in clean energy would need to rise six-fold. All of which sounds highly ambitious. African public finances are in a woeful state. Twenty-two countries are in debt distress or at high risk of it, according to the IMF. Those considering turning to international capital markets are facing eye-watering borrowing costs. China, a source of loans for energy schemes over the past two decades, is becoming more parsimonious. Its lending to domestic African power schemes fell from a peak of nearly $8bn in 2016 to $1. 5bn in 2019. African firms could invest more in infrastructure. Some governments, such as Kenya’s, are changing regulations to allow pension funds to do so. But pension assets in the ten most developed African countries (a bit more than $300bn) are only slightly greater than those of the California state teachers’ pension fund. Investors rarely lend for long-term projects 70 of loans are for less than five years. The iea reckons the gap will be filled by \"an unprecedented level\" of private foreign capital. Yet investors complain of a shortage of bankable African projects. Coal or gas plants are relatively cheap to build, as most of their lifetime costs come from buying fuel. Solar- or wind-power projects, by contrast, are cheap to run but expensive to build. This means they are very sensitive to the cost of capital. And that cost can be up to seven times higher in Africa than in America and Europe, the iea notes. Governments in rich countries have promised climate finance that, among other things, is meant to encourage private investment in renewables. The IEA calculates some $1. 2trn will be needed by 2030. Yet the past is filled with broken promises. In 2009 rich countries pledged $100bn a year to poor countries by 2020 to help with climate change (some of it from the private sector). But the annual amount has never surpassed $85bn and much of it has been in the form of loans. Rich countries have now promised they will reach the $100bn target this year. \"Talk is cheap,\" laments Murefu Barasa of EED Advisory, a Nairobi-based consultancy. \"Nobody knows even how to account for that money. \"Namibia shows that a bankable project can be put together. The government has prioritised the scheme, establishing a \"green hydrogen council\" to streamline decision-making. It has gone out of its way to minimise the risk of corruption, for instance by installing 24-hour surveillance cameras in the facility where contractors’ bids were scrutinised. The project is attracting concessional finance from the Netherlands and Germany, which has in turn lowered the risk for private investors. But it is just one scheme. One reason there are not more is because many utilities are struggling. More than half of those in sub-Saharan Africa cannot cover their operating costslet alone fund investments. Because they bring in revenue, they \"are the foundations of the building of the power sector,\" says Pedro Antmann, a consultant. If they fail, \"the whole building collapses. \"Most are state-owned, inefficient and plagued by political interference. Some utilities barely track their finances. Until 2020 Ethiopia’s simply could not say with certainty if the previous year was profitable. Many do not maintain equipment, stop illegal connections or bill properly. The Electricity Company of Ghana suffers from all three problems and loses 28 of its power, admits Samuel Dubik Masubir Mahama, the managing director. (Losses in American utilities are typically about 5. ) It recently ran an amnesty in which some 120,000 people who had meters but were not paying came forward. Mr Mahama had no record of 104,000 of them. How many more might be out there \"I think it’d be quite a number,\" he chuckles. Most African utilities do not charge tariffs that reflect costs. At root this is a political problem. Andre de Ruyter, the head of Eskom, the South African utility that has overseen record blackouts in 2022, admits it has been \"politically expedient\" for regulators to keep prices low. This has caused a shortfall of 380bn rand ($23bn) since 1994, he reckons, about the same amount as the company’s debts. Other governments directly subsidise electricity tariffs. Removing subsidies entirely is not easy. \"You cannot,\" laments Mamadou Fall Kane, who advises Senegal’s president on energy policy. \"Politically you will kill yourself. \"If cheap tariffs were targeted at only the poor, many utilities could stay in the black without government bungs. In 2018 Niger got rid of all subsidised tariffs except for those to the poorest, who are 29 of consumers but use just 1. 8 of electricity. Plug it inNew technology means that some consumers can bypass utilities. In rural areas, stand-alone \"mini grids\" linked to small generators such as a solar park are often the cheapest way for villages to get connected. Solar-home systems are booming. Going off-grid is only a partial solution, however. Connecting households to the grid remains the cheapest way of lighting up about 45 of unelectrified African households, according to the IEA. But without support the poor often cannot afford the upfront costs of connections. Using grids and building connections between African countries would also make it easier to rely more on renewables. That way a cloudy day at a solar park in Senegal could be offset by a dazzling one in Mali. Yet in most parts other than southern Africa, regional interconnections are weak. And these regional links require trust that a neighbouring country will not halt power exports in a crisis. Sweat equityAfrica’s fragmented infrastructure is one reason why gas has played such a big role in powering the continent. In the ten years to 2021 about two-thirds of new generation capacity in Africa came from gas-fired stations. Even if African countries invest heavily in renewables over coming decades, many will still need an on-demand source of electricity to cover the vagaries of the weather. Hydropower can help, but only in places blessed with steep valleys and rivers. And gas remains hard to beat for directly powering heavy industry. The view at many of west Africa’s biggest ports provides a reality check for anyone hoping for an all-renewable future. Looming over harbour after harbour are hulking beasts, loaded with glistening pipes, rows of smoke stacks and, squeezed on the end, a power pylon. In recent years the governments of Gambia, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast, Senegal and Sierra Leone have signed contracts for these floating fossil-fuel power plants. They produce a large share of those countries’ electricity. Some run on heavy fuel oil, but Ghana’s now runs on local gas. Senegal is converting its, too. Happily, in much of the continent renewables are already cost-competitive with gas and coal. By 2030 they should be more so. Better and cheaper batteries could eventually help renewables cope more easily with peak demand. But for now, in places with abundant gas reserves, little hydropower potential or frequent outages throughout the day, gas-fired plants may still offer the most compelling combination of flexibility, stability and priceat least for some new generation. That is why the West’s reluctance to finance gas projects is in conflict with Africa’s desire to use more energy. Last year 39 countries and organisations including almost all of the world’s big, rich democraciescall them the Virtue-signalling 39, or v 39pledged to stop almost all financing of new fossil-fuel projects internationally by the end of the year. The World Bank is pulling back, too. The hypocrisy is easy to spot three-quarters of the European members of the v 39 are building new fossil-fuel pipelines at home. Gas exploration and development are largely financed by private firms, so the ban will not stop gas being found and pumped. Senegal did not need World Bank money to develop its soon-to-produce gas field, points out Mr Fall Kane, \"because we have the market and we have world demand\". Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices soaring, making private investment even easier to attract. And despite many European countries’ refusal to finance overseas gas projects, the European Union recently labelled the fuel as green, which would allow Europe’s projects to be backed by environmental investors. In recent years rich countries and multilateral banks have financed about $4bn in gas-power plants on average per year in low- and middle-income countries. Much of that funding will now be halted. The v 39 pledge will not stop Africa’s gas from being extracted. But it will ensure it will be mainly rich countries (including members of the v 39) that get to burn it. Gaslighting AfricaAfricans are understandably angry. They argue, convincingly, that Africans using more gas should not be a cause for climate panic. Consider a thought-experiment in which sub-Saharan Africa (excluding already higher-consuming South Africa) increases its electricity consumption per head overnight by an extraordinary factor of five. That would give it a level of electricity consumption per person akin to that of Indonesia todaya scarcely conceivable transformation for ordinary Africans and one which took Indonesia almost three decades to achieve. Even if all the new electricity came exclusively from gas-fired power stations (which no one is suggesting), these would add the equivalent of about 1 of current global emissions. Such calculations hint at a blunt truth. Because so many Africans are poor they are much more vulnerable to the harms of global warming, such as droughts, disease and higher food prices, than people in richer countries. For much of Africa the best way of adapting to a warming planet is to become rich enough to deal with its consequences. Denying Africans cheap and reliable power will make this task much harder, while doing almost nothing to curb global warming.",

Soon afterwards, the South African mining firm got messages from several self-styled \"business forums\", a euphemism belying their real interest extortion. The forums demanded a cut of the contract to construct the plant. They followed up with texts to employees and unauthorised visits to the mine, which lies just outside Johannesburg.

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKThe consequences of non-compliance were not spelt out. But they could be assumed. Since 2015 forums have spread from the province of KwaZulu-Natal to the rest of the country, invading construction sites and demanding a share of any deal. In 2019 forums affected at least 183 projects, worth more than 63bn rand ($4bn). That year gun-toting forum members led to two firms pulling out of a project to build what would have been the highest bridge in Africa. After the incident the boss of the South African firm said of its German partner \"They have worked in 80 countries, including Afghanistan and Iraq, but have never experienced anything like this. \"From bad to worseThere is a lot of crime in South Africa. In the past few months alone there has been a spate of shootings in taverns, a mass rape in a mining town and multiple kidnappings. These are not random incidents, notes Mark Shaw, director of the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime (GI-TOC), a think-tank headquartered in Geneva. They are a result of flourishing organised crime that is \"an existential threat to South Africa’s democratic institutions, economy and people\". In a report last month GI-TOC described 15 illicit \"markets\", ten of which it said are growing. (The other five are \"stable\". ) In an earlier paper it ranked South Africa 19th in the world for organised criminality, ahead of Libya and Russia. \"Few countries host so many illicit markets across such a broad spectrum of criminal activity. \"South Africa is a transit point for heroin going from Afghanistan to Europe and cocaine leaving Latin America for Asia and Australasia. It is also a hive of wildlife crime the familiar scourges of rhino and elephant poaching as well as the trafficking of rock lobster, abalone (marine snails) and succulent plants. Kidnapping cases rose from 6,000 in the year to March 2021 to more than 10,000 12 months later, in part because of the rise of syndicates who demand ransoms (see chart). The gun-runners who deal in the more than 2m unregistered firearms in the country make everything worse. Yet many criminal enterprises target more prosaic parts of the economy. The sharp rise in the copper price in 2020 led to a surge in cable theft. South Africa’s telecommunications firms have formed a special unit partly to combat the crime. Eskom, the state power utility, says cable worth about 2bn rand is stolen every year. Transnet, the public freight-rail operator, said in October 2021 that more than 1,000km of cable had been stolen so far that year. During the pandemic criminals stripped PRASA, the state passenger-rail company. The network carries 4 of the passenger volume it did from 1999 to 2008. One source of vandalism is the so-called \"taxi industry\", which runs the minibuses used by two-thirds of commuters. Earlier this year a taxi firm’s employee was jailed for torching a PRASA train and station the prosecutor noted that \"only the taxi industry benefits when trains are put out of service. \" GI-TOC says taxis are run by \"mafia-like associations\". About half of South Africa’s assassinations are linked to the taxi business. Its cash-only model makes it a potential money-laundry. South African mining is besieged by criminality. Tens of thousands of zama zamas, or illegal miners, work for criminal outfits. An industry body reckons they cost the sector 7bn rand a year. Illustrating the scale of illegal operations, in April the military and a private-security firm retook control of a chrome mine that had been extracting metal worth more than 1m rand a day. Around 10 of South Africa’s annual chrome production is exported illegally. A recent survey reckoned there were about 20 illegal chrome-processing plants. Major figures in the South African underworld operate in myriad markets. Consider, for instance, Petros Sydney Mabuza, a kingpin assassinated last year. As well as running a rhino-poaching syndicate, he was reportedly involved in the taxi industry, extortion and robbery of vans carrying cash. At his funeral a helicopter brought his casket to the venue, with the box draped in leopard skin. South Africa’s organised-crime boom has many causes. But the chief one is that the state has been enfeebled by a corrupt ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC). The police, too, are regularly implicated. Officers have been convicted, among other offences, of drug-dealing, gun-running and aiding illegal mining. In North West province police are said to help deliver food and guns to zama zamas, and serve as hitmen for a mining kingpin. The rot starts at the topThough organised crime predated and outlasted Jacob Zuma, president from 2009 to 2018, it exploded under his reign. Law-enforcement agencies were hollowed out and stuffed with cronies. Crime data show the impact. In the first half of the 2010s there was a 60 drop in the number of arrests and an 83 fall in convictions. The murder rate fell by more than half from 1994, when Nelson Mandela was elected, to 2011. Since then it has risen by 38. \"State capture\" under Mr Zuma has been well documented. But criminality runs deeper than government graft. Many business forums, for example, are said to have links to the ANC ’s \"radical economic transformation\" faction, which is aligned to Mr Zuma. These groups say they are not gangsters but vehicles for black empowerment when they invade sites they demand 30 of the construction contract’s value, citing a law that reserves that fraction for \"local\" firms in public procurement. One group was even called the Federation for Radical Economic Transformation. Cyril Ramaphosa, Mr Zuma’s successor, promised to overhaul law enforcement. But as usual there is a chasm between his rhetoric and reality. Rather than rely on the state, those who can afford it opt for private security. In 1997 there was roughly one private security guard for every policeman. Today the ratio is almost four to one. Gold Fields stood its groundbut only after it built fences at the site and procured private security for employees. Ultimately the extortionists went away. But they will be back somewhere else, soon enough.",

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKThose running businesses in sub-Saharan Africa, even in relatively prosperous countries such as Ghana, face a scarcely conceivable array of problems. Chief among them is access to finance. Alas, government and donor efforts to fix the problems often go awry. Mr Djameh has many advantages for a would-be brewing kingpin. He studied beer-making in Munich and has worked for Ghana’s biggest brewers. Beer-glugging foreigners love his concoctions. His microbrewery was Ghana’s first. And his use of sorghum stemmed from his work on a multimillion-dollar government- and un -backed project to reduce poverty by encouraging Ghanaian farmers to grow the grain to supply brewers. Ghana’s beer barons have been sniffy about using sorghum. Mr Djameh’s business offers a way to make something of the project. To ramp up production from a mere 200 litres a batch in 2016, Mr Djameh began looking for about $400,000 to buy bigger brewing equipment and lots more kegs. He applied for an interest-free loan under a special scheme at a state bank and was approved, he says. But the bank then said it had no cash to lend. The cheap-loan scheme was later changed into one that charged 10 interest. That did not deter Mr Djameh, who was keen to reap economies of scale. \"Breweries always make money,\" he grins. However, he balked when the loan officer wanted a 10 kickback, he says, adding \"If you’re not prepared to pay and you don’t have a strong political connection, you will not get the money. \"Ghana’s government is now broke and in talks with the imf. The central bank has increased its main interest rate to 24. 5. Borrowing costs on commercial loans are higher still. Even a brewer would find them prohibitive. Mr Djameh’s latest plan is to find parched investors wanting to buy a share of the company. Yet one of the potential financiers who is interested may bring trouble. \"He is a drug dealer,\" chuckles Mr Djameh. \"It’s not really the kind of money that you want to work with. \"In World Bank surveys a quarter of sub-Saharan African firms cited access to finance as their biggest obstacle. This is far higher than for other constraints. After years trying to raise money to expand, Mr Djameh is still stuck brewing small batches. To make ends meet, he has long worked as a consultant to aid projects across Africa on how to grow sorghum and use it for brewing. Frustrated, he may focus on this work. That reveals a bitter irony it is often not just easier, but more profitable, to work for an aid outfit promoting clever schemes to transform African economies than to build businesses that do so.",

            "maintext": "I t was an inauspicious start to ending a catastrophic war. The first official direct peace talks between the Ethiopian government and the leaders of Tigray, its rebellious northern region, were meant to have begun in early October in South Africa. When they at last opened on October 24th, the delegation sent from Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, had still not arrived. Its chief negotiator, Ethiopia’s deputy prime minister, Demeke Mekonnen, failed to show up at all. Thus the first scheduled day of talks slipped by without progress. Listen to this story.

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKThere ought to be no time to waste. Hundreds of thousands are believed to have died in the war, which is about to enter its third year, either in the fighting or from hunger and disease. Millions of civilians in Tigray, the focus of the conflict, are under blockade and running out of food and medicine. Almost no aid has entered the region since late August, when a five-month humanitarian truce ended. Since then tens of thousands of ill-trained recruits from Ethiopia and neighbouring Eritrea have been slung into battle against the self-styled Tigray Defence Force (TDF). The mounting devastation and risk of yet more atrocities in a conflict already deeply stained by the blood of murdered civilians are reasons why many Ethiopians and outsiders hope for a swiftly negotiated end to the war. They will probably be disappointed. Ethiopia seems to be in no rush to talk because its forces and their Eritrean allies have made rapid gains on the battlefield. On October 17th they captured the strategic town of Shire and soon after that the historic cities of Adwa and Axum (see map). Just days later Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, proclaimed that victory was nigh. Federal forces now appear to be closing on Mekelle, Tigray’s regional capital. This raises the prospect of Tigray’s leaders, the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), being forced to evacuate the city for the mountains as they did in November 2020. Then, too, Abiy declared victory. Yet Tigrayan troops soon switched to guerrilla tactics and in July 2021 regained control of Mekelle and other key towns. The latest advance of Ethiopian and Eritrean troops into Tigray has sparked an exodus of hundreds of thousands of civilians into the countryside. Many remember the lootings, murder and rapes during the occupation by federal forces last year. \"Massive displacement again,\" says a UN official. \"The numbers are staggering. \" The prospect of an even greater humanitarian disaster is shaking outsiders. On October 17th the UN secretary-general, Antnio Guterres, warned that the situation was \"spiralling out of control\". Both the AU and the UN Security Council have since met to discuss the crisis. In the talks Tigray’s leaders have demanded an immediate halt in fighting (as have the AU and Western countries). But Abiy and Issaias Afewerki, Eritrea’s dictator, are unlikely to agree to this. Instead they seem determined to repeat the trick the TPLF itself pulled off in 1991 when it was a rebel army fighting the oppressive communist junta running Ethiopia. That was to make ongoing peace talks redundant with a decisive military victory. People familiar with the government’s plan say it is to install an interim administration in Tigray while it hunts down whatever remains of the TPLF ’s leadership. There is little reason to believe this effort would be any more successful than a previous attempt in early 2021. And although Tigray’s leaders may soon relinquish control of Mekelle, they are unlikely to give up the fight. \"The only option we have is to resist,\" said Debretsion Gebremichael, the regional president, on October 24th. Indeed, the TPLF ’s great strength lies in guerrilla warfare. It was using these tactics that it overthrew the central government in 1991 (before taking the reins itself for the next three decades) and kicked the occupying Ethiopian and Eritrean armies out of Tigray last year. \"They’re going to make Tigray ungovernable,\" predicts Alex Rondos, a former EU special envoy to the Horn of Africa. Abiy, meanwhile, is already battling on other fronts. On October 22nd rebels in Oromia, the largest region, said a government drone strike had killed scores of civilians there. The task of pacifying Tigray will further stretch Abiy’s forces and the country’s fast-deteriorating economy. A protracted insurgency in Tigray is the last thing Ethiopia needs now.",

                "i t was an inauspicious start to ending a catastrophic war. the first official direct peace talks between the ethiopian government and the leaders of tigray, its rebellious northern region, were meant to have begun in early october in south africa. when they at last opened on october 24th, the delegation sent from addis ababa, the ethiopian capital, had still not arrived. its chief negotiator, ethiopia’s deputy prime minister, demeke mekonnen, failed to show up at all. thus the first scheduled day of talks slipped by without progress.",

                "there ought to be no time to waste. hundreds of thousands are believed to have died in the war, which is about to enter its third year, either in the fighting or from hunger and disease. millions of civilians in tigray, the focus of the conflict, are under blockade and running out of food and medicine. almost no aid has entered the region since late august, when a five-month humanitarian truce ended.",
                "since then tens of thousands of ill-trained recruits from ethiopia and neighbouring eritrea have been slung into battle against the self-styled tigray defence force (tdf). the mounting devastation and risk of yet more atrocities in a conflict already deeply stained by the blood of murdered civilians are reasons why many ethiopians and outsiders hope for a swiftly negotiated end to the war.",
                "they will probably be disappointed. ethiopia seems to be in no rush to talk because its forces and their eritrean allies have made rapid gains on the battlefield. on october 17th they captured the strategic town of shire and soon after that the historic cities of adwa and axum (see map). just days later abiy ahmed, ethiopia’s prime minister, proclaimed that victory was nigh. federal forces now appear to be closing on mekelle, tigray’s regional capital. this raises the prospect of tigray’s leaders, the tigrayan people’s liberation front (tplf), being forced to evacuate the city for the mountains as they did in november 2020. then, too, abiy declared victory. yet tigrayan troops soon switched to guerrilla tactics and in july 2021 regained control of mekelle and other key towns. the latest advance of ethiopian and eritrean troops into tigray has sparked an exodus of hundreds of thousands of civilians into the countryside. many remember the lootings, murder and rapes during the occupation by federal forces last year. \"massive displacement again,\" says a un official. \"the numbers are staggering. \" the prospect of an even greater humanitarian disaster is shaking outsiders. on october 17th the un secretary-general, antnio guterres, warned that the situation was \"spiralling out of control\". both the au and the un security council have since met to discuss the crisis. in the talks tigray’s leaders have demanded an immediate halt in fighting (as have the au and western countries). but abiy and issaias afewerki, eritrea’s dictator, are unlikely to agree to this. instead they seem determined to repeat the trick the tplf itself pulled off in 1991 when it was a rebel army fighting the oppressive communist junta running ethiopia. that was to make ongoing peace talks redundant with a decisive military victory. people familiar with the government’s plan say it is to install an interim administration in tigray while it hunts down whatever remains of the tplf ’s leadership.",
                "there is little reason to believe this effort would be any more successful than a previous attempt in early 2021. and although tigray’s leaders may soon relinquish control of mekelle, they are unlikely to give up the fight. \"the only option we have is to resist,\" said debretsion gebremichael, the regional president, on october 24th. indeed, the tplf ’s great strength lies in guerrilla warfare. it was using these tactics that it overthrew the central government in 1991 (before taking the reins itself for the next three decades) and kicked the occupying ethiopian and eritrean armies out of tigray last year. \"they’re going to make tigray ungovernable,\" predicts alex rondos, a former eu special envoy to the horn of africa.",
                "abiy, meanwhile, is already battling on other fronts. on october 22nd rebels in oromia, the largest region, said a government drone strike had killed scores of civilians there. the task of pacifying tigray will further stretch abiy’s forces and the country’s fast-deteriorating economy. a protracted insurgency in tigray is the last thing ethiopia needs now."

Concrete blocks lie wet from the rain that has fallen through roofless rooms. Completing the half-built house was the task of her husband, Siyabonga Mkhize. But he was shot dead in October 2021 when out campaigning to be a councillor for the African National Congress (ANC), South Africa’s ruling party. It was too late to take his name off the ballot, so he was posthumously elected. In March the by-election to find a living replacement was won by another ANC candidate, Mzi Ngiba. Two months later Mr Ngiba was one of four people arrested for his predecessor’s murder. (All deny the charges. ) \"He was a kind person,\" says Ms Mkhize of her husband. \"But he was murdered for his choice of becoming an ANC politician. \"Listen to this story.

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKStories like Mr Mkhize’s are surprisingly common. From 2000 to 2021 at least 418 political assassinations took place, most of them in the past seven years. These typically involve competition for positions within the anc. The murders are an extreme consequence of what itand the country it governshave become. The party that fought apartheid is now a patronage machine draped in revolutionary rhetoric. In a state where almost half of black South Africans are unemployed and where crime goes unpunished, it is grimly rational to kill to get a lucrative political job. Over the past fortnight South Africans have been gripped by questions over the future of Cyril Ramaphosa. The president, who took office in 2018 pledging to reduce graft, was briefly on the brink of resignation after a report by a panel of judges concluded there was enough evidence of his misconduct for MP s to consider impeaching him. The scandal in question is related to the theft of at least $580,000 from Mr Ramaphosa’s game farm, by unknown criminals. Questions have been asked about where the money came from and why it was hidden in a sofa. Mr Ramaphosa has a large fortune, legally earned, but the presence of so much cash on his property struck many as odd. The president says he has done nothing wrong, and on December 13th a majority of MP s voted against impeaching him, with all but a few ANC parliamentarians toeing the party line. \"Farmgate\" is a plotline in a broader story, the next chapter of which begins on December 16th, when the ANC meets to elect its leaders. That story is the self-destruction of the ruling party and the collateral damage to South Africa. The ANC was founded in 1912 to campaign against the exploitation of black Africans and the expropriation of their property. In 1948 its nemesis, the National Party, took power and introduced apartheid, a system of overt racial discrimination favouring whites. ANC leaders, including Nelson Mandela, organised occasionally violent opposition. In 1960 the party was outlawed and its members were driven underground or into exile. Three decades later, as white South Africans tired of being global pariahs, the apartheid regime unbanned the anc. As soon as black South Africans were given the vote, the party became the government. Mandela preached reconciliation and \"a better life for all\". Some trace the ANC ’s misgovernance to its past. During the dark years when it was operating underground or in exile and was vulnerable to penetration by apartheid spies and assassins, it developed a culture of secrecy, paranoia and unaccountability as a survival mechanism. These traits are hardly a recipe for governing well or cleanly. \"We thought the ANC would be the torch-bearer of revolution, and clean up the mess of apartheid,\" says Protas Madlala, an anti-apartheid activist. \"Instead they’ve just looked after themselves. \"But \"the rot was not inevitable\", argues Kgalema Motlanthe, an ANC veteran who briefly served as president between Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma. Leaders after Mandelaincluding Mr Mbeki, Mr Ramaphosa and himselfdid not do enough to stop graft, he concedes. Mr Mbeki lambasted looting in abstract terms, decrying the materialism of newly rich blacks, but did too little to stop it. His desire to create a black middle class by the \"deployment\" of party members into public jobs encouraged it. Once Mr Zuma became president, corruption hit new heights. Pundits spoke of \"state capture\" the systematic looting of public money by anc bigwigs. The rot that started at the top has spread downwards. Lethal battles rage over political jobs because they offer power to award tenders to cronies. \"People who join the ANC now do so not because they want to help people, but to pursue their personal ambitions and business opportunities,\" says Nhlakanipho Ntombela, who, as head of elections for the ANC in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, is in charge of asking people to vote for the party. For a while corruption happened alongside an improvement in the lives of ordinary South Africans. The murder rate, a proxy for violent crime, fell by more than half between 1995 and 2011. Unemployment fell for most of the 2000s. The ANC built a basic welfare state that provided millions of homes, as well as cash grants for mothers and old people. But over the past decade corruption has exploded and living conditions have got worse. Real incomes for the top 5 grew more than twice as fast as the overall economy. For everyone else they were stagnant or rose only slightly. The murder rate is ticking up again. South Africans have spent twice as long in the dark because of blackouts in 2022 as in any previous year. Half of all running water is lost through broken pipes. The state has all but given up on many of its responsibilities. Those who can afford it generate their own electricity and pay for private schools, health insurance and security guards. Or they emigrate. \"Today the general public has very little faith and trust in the ANC,\" says Mr Motlanthe. \"Slogans and ideologies only count if basic needs are being taken care of. \"Mr Ramaphosa’s supporters argue that, if re-elected as ANC president, he will lead a \"renewal\" of the party. They also point out that his narrow victory at the previous party conference hampered his presidency from the start he had few allies in the ANC ’s National Executive Committee, including among its \"top six\", a sort of politburo (with all of the ruthlessness but none of the efficiency that word implies). If he wins convincingly this time, goes the argument, the president will have more time to govern. Allies say his strengthening of institutions such as the National Prosecuting Authority show he is a reformist at heart. Mr Ramaphosa, for all his faults, is the best ANC leader the country can hope for. His main rival for the job, Zweli Mkhize, is implicated in an alleged scam involving the theft of money meant to fight covid-19. Paul Mashatile, who is running for deputy president of the party, has done little to suggest he would be an improvement. Yet \"renewal\" is unlikely, for several reasons. Mr Ramaphosa is a cautious man, who would set up a committee to decide what to have for breakfast. Although Mr Zuma’s acolytes are weakened, several nominees for the NEC are facing graft charges. The top six jobs will not be won by serious reformers, for such people are nowhere to seen. They will probably be filled by nominees of provincial power barons. Their growing influence reflects how the ANC is increasingly a rural party. As a result it has indulged \"traditional leaders\" and placated provincial party bosses. In return these bigwigs want policies that will favour them (\"special economic zones\" are popular) and senior positions. They do not want renewal they want deals. Perhaps most important, the ANC is increasingly at odds with modern South Africa. It lacks an internal culture of democracy and individual accountability for its leaders. It seldom distinguishes between the party and the state. \"The party’s history left it ill-equipped to govern a liberal democracy,\" argues Ralph Mathekga in his book \"The ANC ’s last decade\". In it he argues that \"bluntly, the ANC in its current state and South Africa’s constitution are just not a very good fit. \" The ANC is in decline. Its vote share fell from 66 at the general election in 2009 to 58 in 2019. Last year it won less than 50 of the vote nationwide at municipal elections. Asked how the party has done in by-elections since then, Mr Ntombela pauses and says \"We’ve been walloped. \" Mr Ramaphosa is still more popular than his party. If he does not lead the ANC into the next election, it would probably hasten the party’s decline. In a recent poll by the Social Research Foundation, a think-tank, 48 of ANC voters said that Mr Ramaphosa was \"very important\" to their support for the party (see chart). Even if he does lead, the party may well win less than half of the vote in a general election for the first time. The party’s overThe decline of the ANC evokes mixed feelings among South Africans. Few will mourn its collapse. Yet many worry about what comes next. There are two main risks. The first is that in the short term, if Mr Ramaphosa is ousted, the pro-corruption faction of the party will use what time it has to loot without restraint. The second, over the medium term, concerns what might happen as South Africa enters a new era of coalition politics. (Under its proportional-representation system, if no party wins a majority of the vote, this is all but inevitable. ) Coalitions could mean compromise and pragmatism. But, as is the case already in many city governments, they could also mean even more mouths at the trough.",

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKSince the Islamic revolution of 1979 that convulsed Iran and threatened the thrones of Sunni Arab monarchs across the Gulf, Bahrain has been on the fault line of the Sunni-Shia division. It is the only country in the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council where the indigenous majority is Shia most of the people in the other five are staunchly Sunni. And it lies awkwardly squeezed between two large ideological foes, Iran and Saudi Arabia. After the ayatollahs took over Iran, Bahrain’s two sects sought succour from those bigger brothers, sometimes accusing each other of unbelief. Narrow-minded Sunni clerics denounced shrines, like those of Nabi Saleh, as insults to monotheism. Yet sectarian feeling may be softening. Saudi Arabia has muzzled its more extreme Islamists and embarked on a more secular drive. The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain’s other big patron, has banned Sunni Islamist parties and encouraged other Gulf governments to follow suit. Sunni Islamist parties did badly in Bahrain’s recent election to choose members of an assembly that advises the all-powerful monarch, Hamad al-Khalifa. Bahrain’s Sunni clergy may be shedding its sectarianism too. Younger Shias may want their own clergy to reciprocate. The cries of protesters seeking to topple the Shia theocracy in Iran are being heard in Bahrain. Some Bahraini Shias are annoyed by the support their theologians are giving to the Iranian ayatollahs. \"It’s hypocrisy,\" says a Shia activist. \"They have slogans for human rights here, but they’re very conservative and don’t want women to have better chances. \" So Bahrain’s Shia religious establishment is also under pressure to be more liberal and less in thrall to their counterparts in Iran. Social harmony between Shias and Sunnis in Bahrain would be enhanced still more if the ruling family bestowed equal political rights on the Shia majority. The main Shia party, al-Wefaq, is banned, so the recent election took place without its participation. Moreover, the ruling family grants most of the top army and security posts to Sunnis. Radio and television are broadcast in a Sunni dialect. The Sunni version of Islam is the one taught in schools. The names of Shia villages are often erased from signposts medieval Shia mosques are unmarked on maps. Maryam wants Sunnis and Shias to worship together at the island shrine. That may not be to the taste of the Khalifas. If the sects co-operated in politics as well as in religion, the people of Bahrain would find it easier to hold their ruling family to account. They might even demand a constitutional monarchy. The recent election is a long way from allowing that.",

            "maintext": "A week before Israelis went to the polls on November 1st, a team of Israeli soldiers carried out an unusual raid in the old city of Nablus. By day its casbah is a lively place, famed for its sweets. But in the pre-dawn hours of October 25th it was a war zone. Five Palestinians were killed and dozens injured. Another Palestinian was killed in a different episode that evening. Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the element. Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKThe target was a new armed Palestinian group called the Lions’ Den. It has claimed responsibility for a string of attacks on Israeli soldiers in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which Palestinians see as the future core of an independent state. Israeli police say they also foiled a planned attack by the Lions in Tel Aviv in September. The raid, which followed weeks of restrictions on Nablus residents, felt reminiscent of the Palestinians’ bloody intifada, or uprising, two decades ago. In recent years Israeli soldiers had rarely entered the old city, let alone fired off shoulder-fired missiles in the middle of town. The West Bank is boiling. The United Nations says that this year is likely to be the deadliest for Palestinians there since 2005. Israelis say they had to respond to an upsurge of Palestinian militancy in March and April, when attacks occurred in four different cities in Israel. A government led by Binyamin Netanyahu, especially if it includes the far right, may raise tensions in the West Bank further. Yair Lapid, the outgoing prime minister, was hardly a dove. Though he endorsed the two-state solution at the UN General Assembly in September, he made no effort to end the conflict during his four months in office. In the first ten months of this year at least 109 Palestinians, including 28 children, have been killed by Israeli soldiers in the West Bank, a 40 increase on the tally for the whole of 2021. Violence by Jewish settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank, much of it unpunished, has been rising too. The UN has recorded 577 attacks this year, up from 496 in 2021. Mohammed Shtayyeh, the Palestinian prime minister, describes the contrast between Israeli governments as the \"difference between Pepsi and Coke\". Still, a Netanyahu coalition with the far right could add fuel to the fire in several places. First is Jerusalem. Itamar Ben-Gvir, a co-leader of the far-right Religious Zionism bloc that hopes to team up in government with Mr Netanyahu’s Likud party, wants to be minister of public security, in charge of the police. Some far-right activists hope this will mean changes on the Temple Mount, Judaism’s holiest site, which is also sacred to Muslims and a symbol of Palestinian national identity. Those activists may be disappointed. In the past Mr Netanyahu has been cautious about changing the status quo on the plateau, where Jews are forbidden to pray openly and face restrictions on when they may visit. Even if the rules do not change, though, a visit there by Mr Ben-Gvir, whom Palestinians revile, could touch off riots. For their part, Palestinians have lost faith in the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the West Bank under Israel’s eye. Mahmoud Abbas, its 86-year-old president, took office for a four-year term in 2005 and never left. A survey in September found that 74 of Palestinians want him to resign and 46 want to dissolve the PA altogether. Younger ones, in particular, see little reason to trust their ageing leaders. Some members of the Lions’ Den come from families linked to Fatah, Mr Abbas’s party. Ibrahim al-Nabulsi, one of its founders who was killed in an Israeli raid in August, was the son of a PA intelligence officer. During his previous 12-year stint as prime minister, Mr Netanyahu undermined the PA. He periodically withheld the tax revenues that Israel collects on its behalf, starving the authority of funds. He had no interest in peace negotiations in 2020 he promoted a plan for Israel to annex chunks of the West Bank. If he weakens the feeble PA still more, the territory could slide towards anarchy. Israel has imposed a blockade on Gaza, the other bit of a would-be Palestinian state, since 2007, when Hamas, a militant Islamist group, took control. Egypt, which borders Gaza, also keeps tight restrictions on it. Many Israeli security officials argue it is time to rethink the embargo, which has not dislodged Hamas from power but has brought misery to Gaza’s 2m people. Israel’s outgoing government did offer a few small gestures toward Gaza’s battered economy. It more than doubled the number of permits for Gazans to work in Israel, to 17,000. Mr Lapid had hoped to raise it to 20,000. That is a small fraction of the 100,000 Gazans who worked in Israel before Hamas took over. Still, it offered some relief to thousands of families. The median wage in Gaza is 33 shekels ($9) a day Palestinian labourers in Israel can earn 266. Successive Israeli governments have shown little interest in lifting the blockade of Gaza. Mr Netanyahu is likely to retain itand is certain to clobber Hamas as fiercely as ever in any future conflict. Whatever the shape of the new Israeli government, it will bring little comfort to the Palestinians, whether in a blighted Gaza or a seething West Bank.",

It is a creed that has been tested almost to destruction by Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister and an alumnus of the Israeli unit. After four failed attempts and 16 months in opposition, Mr Netanyahu seems to have won a parliamentary majority that will put him back in the prime minister’s office. Listen to this story.

The tally shows that the group of right-wing and religious parties supporting Mr Netanyahu are almost certain to have 62-65 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, having won just a few thousand more votes than their rivals. Mr Netanyahu owes his remarkable comeback to a surge in nationalist voting whipped up by his far-right allies in the Jewish Power party. Another contributing factor was the chronic division among centre-left and Arab parties, two of which seem to have failed to cross the electoral threshold of 3. 25. These differences led to the early demise of the government formed in June 2021 by a broad coalition assembled by Yair Lapid that included right-wing, centrist, left-wing and Islamist parties. In a victory speech to members of his Likud party in Jerusalem, Mr Netanyahu triumphantly declared that \"our way, the way of Likud, proved itself. \" In fact, Likud has barely increased its tally from the previous election in March 2021. The big gains made by his bloc are almost entirely due to the astonishing success of the Religious Zionism list, which includes the Jewish Power party, that more than doubled its number of seats. Mr Netanyahu had prevailed upon the Jewish Power leader, Itamar Ben-Gvir, to merge his list with that of two other far-right parties, ensuring that votes for his camp would not be wasted on parties falling below the threshold. Mr Ben-Gvir was until very recently a political pariah. His rsum includes threatening to \"get to\" the former prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, shortly before his assassination by a Jewish extremist in 1995, and membership of a virulently anti-Arab party that was proscribed by the Israeli government as a terrorist organisation. As recently as the election held in March 2020, Jewish Power won just 19,000 votes. Mr Netanyahu, however, legitimised him and launched him on a rocket-like trajectory. On the day of the election Mr Ben-Gvir was mobbed by adulatory crowds as he toured working-class and religious neighbourhoods. He promised them that, with him in the new government, \"we will be the landlords. \" He is now the co-leader of the third-largest party in the Knesset and can dictate his terms to Mr Netanyahu, who will need Mr Ben-Gvir if he is to form a government. Top of his wish list is to be appointed public-security minister, in charge of Israel’s police. Mr Netanyahu’s usual coalition partners, the ultra-Orthodox parties, have their own lists of demands. These include bigger budgets for religious schools as well as the right not to teach their children ungodly subjects such as maths and English. The parties in Mr Netanyahu’s coalition also hope to weaken the power of the courts, which they see as an obstacle to their aim of grabbing more land in territories Israel occupied in 1967. That may suit Mr Netanyahu, who is on trial on charges of bribery, fraud and \"breach of trust\". He insists that his innocence will come out in court and denies trying to knobble the legal process. But his allies have spoken of replacing the attorney-general and striking out the crime of breach of trust. After five elections in less than four years, many Israelis crave stability. Yet they may be disappointed in their hope that Mr Netanyahu will provide this. Once back in office he may call yet another election to cut his new partners down to size.",

                "s ayeret matkal, israel’s premier commando unit, did not simply model itself on britain’s special air service (sas), it also stole its motto \"who dares wins\". it is a creed that has been tested almost to destruction by binyamin netanyahu, israel’s longest-serving prime minister and an alumnus of the israeli unit. after four failed attempts and 16 months in opposition, mr netanyahu seems to have won a parliamentary majority that will put him back in the prime minister’s office.",

                "as the economist went to press some 90 of votes cast in the election on november 1st had been counted. the tally shows that the group of right-wing and religious parties supporting mr netanyahu are almost certain to have 62-65 of the 120 seats in the knesset, israel’s parliament, having won just a few thousand more votes than their rivals. mr netanyahu owes his remarkable comeback to a surge in nationalist voting whipped up by his far-right allies in the jewish power party.",
                "another contributing factor was the chronic division among centre-left and arab parties, two of which seem to have failed to cross the electoral threshold of 3. 25. these differences led to the early demise of the government formed in june 2021 by a broad coalition assembled by yair lapid that included right-wing, centrist, left-wing and islamist parties.",
                "in a victory speech to members of his likud party in jerusalem, mr netanyahu triumphantly declared that \"our way, the way of likud, proved itself. \" in fact, likud has barely increased its tally from the previous election in march 2021. the big gains made by his bloc are almost entirely due to the astonishing success of the religious zionism list, which includes the jewish power party, that more than doubled its number of seats. mr netanyahu had prevailed upon the jewish power leader, itamar ben-gvir, to merge his list with that of two other far-right parties, ensuring that votes for his camp would not be wasted on parties falling below the threshold.",
                "mr ben-gvir was until very recently a political pariah. his rsum includes threatening to \"get to\" the former prime minister, yitzhak rabin, shortly before his assassination by a jewish extremist in 1995, and membership of a virulently anti-arab party that was proscribed by the israeli government as a terrorist organisation. as recently as the election held in march 2020, jewish power won just 19,000 votes.",
                "mr netanyahu, however, legitimised him and launched him on a rocket-like trajectory. on the day of the election mr ben-gvir was mobbed by adulatory crowds as he toured working-class and religious neighbourhoods. he promised them that, with him in the new government, \"we will be the landlords. \" he is now the co-leader of the third-largest party in the knesset and can dictate his terms to mr netanyahu, who will need mr ben-gvir if he is to form a government. top of his wish list is to be appointed public-security minister, in charge of israel’s police.",
                "mr netanyahu’s usual coalition partners, the ultra-orthodox parties, have their own lists of demands. these include bigger budgets for religious schools as well as the right not to teach their children ungodly subjects such as maths and english.",
                "the parties in mr netanyahu’s coalition also hope to weaken the power of the courts, which they see as an obstacle to their aim of grabbing more land in territories israel occupied in 1967. that may suit mr netanyahu, who is on trial on charges of bribery, fraud and \"breach of trust\". he insists that his innocence will come out in court and denies trying to knobble the legal process. but his allies have spoken of replacing the attorney-general and striking out the crime of breach of trust.",
                "after five elections in less than four years, many israelis crave stability. yet they may be disappointed in their hope that mr netanyahu will provide this. once back in office he may call yet another election to cut his new partners down to size."

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKLike many of Africa’s pastoralist regions, Karamoja is going through an uneven transition. Elders recall a time when cows were plundered for prestige or bride wealth. But in recent decades cattle-raiding has become big business. Stolen animals are trucked to distant markets, since urban demand for beef has grown. On the grasslands the ownership of livestock is becoming more unequal, as the big owners get bigger and poorer ones struggleand go hungry. \"In Karamoja your bank is a cow, it’s a goat, it’s a sheep,\" says Paul Komol Lotee, chairman of Kotido, one of the districts worst hit by violence. \"If you don’t have the three you will not survive. \"In the 1990s and early 2000s raiders ran rampant in Karamoja. Thousands of cows were stolen. Others died of disease after being crowded into kraals (stockaded enclosures). The army eventually bludgeoned the raiders into submission. By 2010 cattle-keepers began to restock. Now the raiders are back. In Kaabong district they have emptied 32 of 34 kraals, where cattle are meant to be kept safe. Locals blame several factors the flow of guns across the porous border with Kenya a covid-19 lockdown and a foot-and-mouth outbreak, both of which disrupted legal trade and the failure of the police and army to recover stolen cattle, which made young men take the law into their own hands. Hundreds of people were killed. In the search for illegal guns the army has rounded up thousands of young men, often on flimsy pretexts. In March a spokesman said it had killed more than 300 \"warriors\" during disarmament operations. The UN and the government’s own human-rights commission have accused soldiers of extrajudicial killings. Former captives describe being tied to trees and flogged. Locals wonder whether some officers are profiting from the raids. How do truckloads of stolen cattle elude checkpoints Why are army-issue cartridges sometimes left behind after raids The army insists it is not involved. The raids are starting to abate again, partly because of the army campaign, partly because there is little left to steal. In the 2018-19 season Karamoja’s livestock provided $444m of value to their owners, estimates the Karamoja Resilience Support Unit, a research group. Those benefits include meat, milk, ploughing and informal insurance (in an emergency you sell your last cow). Yet even before the latest wave of raiding, most households owned fewer than 3. 3 \"tropical livestock units\" per person, equivalent to about five cows or 33 sheep. Below that threshold a family struggles to get enough calories from livestock, even if it grows some crops on the side. Many Karamojong instead find casual work on farms, brew beer or drive motorbike taxis in the towns. Others scrape by in the economy of petty extraction, burning trees for charcoal or tunnelling for gold. Auda Lokwang leaves her children at home from sunrise to sunset while she gathers firewood in the scrubland, exchanging it in Moroto town for adakai, the edible residue left after brewing sorghum beer. \"You just have to endure,\" she says. For generations, the Karamojong survived a capricious environment by balancing cattle-herding and crop cultivation. \"Should the cattle die, there are crops,\" runs a traditional invocation. \"If the crops do not grow, there are cattle. \" Without cows, they are now more vulnerable to rising food prices, voracious pests and a changing climate, which is making rainfall more erratic. Perhaps cattle-raiding has angered the gods, muses Loita Kume, an elder in Moroto district. Only when the bloodshed stops will the rains return.",

Conflict brewing in the Persian Gulf left Saudi Arabia worried about attacks on its oilfields and eager to procure ballistic missiles to deter its rivals. Rebuffed by America, a young and powerful Saudi prince turned instead to China, which signed a secret deal to supply the kingdom with the weapons it wanted. Listen to this story.

Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OKIf this story evokes a sense of dj vu, it most certainly should. It happened four decades ago and led to the establishment of Sino-Saudi relations in 1990. Much of it has echoes today, as Xi Jinping arrived for a visit to Saudi Arabia on December 7th, his second trip to the kingdom. Not everything is the same, of course. In contrast to the 1980s, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbours now have strong commercial ties with China. Still, plus a change the Saudis continue to treat China as a foil for America, which in their eyes has become a particularly unreliable partner over the past decade. The challenge for Gulf states is how to balance these two views of China. The first has become increasingly alluring. China is a big export market and a major source of investment in the Gulf. The second, in which China serves as a strategic hedge against an erratic America, is less compelling China is no easy substitute. Moreover, in trying to play one power off against the other, Gulf leaders may hasten America’s abandonment of them, which they fear. Start with the Gulf’s economic relationship with China, which is growing. Energy remains at the core. Last year 51 of China’s oil imports came from Arab states, and four-fifths of that came from the monarchies of the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC). In November Sinopec, a state-run energy giant, signed a 27-year agreement to buy liquefied natural gas from Qatar, the longest such gas deal ever. Since 2005 China has signed large investment deals and construction contracts with Arab states worth $223bn, says the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank in Washington. Of that total, 52 has been with the GCC countries (Algeria, Egypt and Iraq took much of the rest). The pace of those deals speeded up in the late 2010s (see chart). Though it has since slowed, due to the pandemic and a slump in Chinese investment worldwide, China continues to see the Gulf as promising. In the first half of 2022 Saudi Arabia received $5. 5bn in investment and contracts through China’s Belt and Road Initiative, more than any other country. Much of this investment remains focused on energy. Trade is oily too Chinese imports from the region are almost entirely petrochemicals and other commodities. Gulf states are keen to shift their economies away from oil and view China as a key partner in that effort. Last year it pumped money into hotels in Oman and auto-manufacturing in Saudi Arabia. Such projects are still outliers, though non-oil investment remains sluggish. None of this causes much angst in America. It is the Gulf’s growing ties with China in strategic sectors that worry people in Washington telecoms, security and, increasingly, defence. GCC members are keen customers of Huawei, the telecoms giant that is under American sanctions, and are happy to do business with companies like SenseTime, an artificial-intelligence firm blacklisted by America for its role in spying on Uyghurs in Xinjiang. In September a company owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund announced a $207m joint venture with SenseTime to build an AI lab in the kingdom. China has also sold armed drones to the UAE, among others, which has used them on battlefields across the region. In March a Saudi firm signed a deal with a state-owned Chinese defence giant to manufacture drones in the kingdom. America’s spies say China is helping Saudi Arabia build ballistic missiles as well. Last month at the Manama Dialogue, an annual security powwow in Bahrain, American officials came with warnings. Brett McGurk, the president’s Middle East adviser, said growing co-operation with China in the region would put a \"ceiling\" on relations with America. Another official acknowledged the tensions in the relationship, particularly over Iran. Mr Xi is being more warmly received than Joe Biden, whose trip to Saudi Arabia in July, his first as president, had an air of desperation oil prices were high, an election loomed, and he needed help. The Saudis sent him home empty-handed. After more than a year of froideur from his people, they were in no mood to be generous. Mr Xi, by contrast, will probably go home with a stack of big investment deals and other announcements. He was due to meet the Saudi leadership, including Muhammad bin Salman, the crown prince and de facto ruler, on December 8th. Next on his schedule is a summit with Gulf leaders and a further meeting with figures from across the Arab world. Saudis joke about the prospect of the taciturn Mr Xi joining a traditional sword dance. Saudi officials insist that none of this is meant as a snub to America China is an important country, they say, and the kingdom treats it as such. Still, the Biden team has had a tricky relationship with Saudi Arabia and sees China as its main competitor. The chummy reception for Mr Xiin contrast to the frosty one for Mr Bidenwill not go down well in Washington. In private, Gulf officials say they are exasperated with an America whose policy seems incoherent. Three consecutive presidents have talked of reducing America’s role in the Middle East, yet they do not want other powers to gain too much influence as they depart. Such frustrations in the Gulf are understandable. But so too are America’s. The GCC complains that America has not done enough to protect it from the Gulf Arabs’ arch-rival Iran, with which China signed a 25-year \"strategic partnership\" last year. Mr Xi is one of the few leaders with real leverage over Iran. Most of the oil exported from Iranian ports, in defiance of American sanctions, finds its way to Chinese refineries. Yet he is loth to use it to bring pressure on Iran’s government. Buoyed by higher oil prices and growing economies, Gulf rulers feel assertive they think this is their moment to step out from America’s shadow. Mr Biden will have to accept a greater Chinese role in the region. But both sides should recognise that, now as in the 1980s, China cannot fully replace America in the Gulf.",
